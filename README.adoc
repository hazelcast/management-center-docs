This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast Management Center documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically build the site using content in the `main` branch as well as any branches that are prefixed with `v/`.

== Release Workflow

Documentation for new releases is hosted in versioned branches that are prefixed with `v/`. The `latest-dev` content (snapshot content) is stored in the `main` branch.

We support documentation for the latest patch releases of minor versions. For example, content for the `5.0` version is hosted in the `v/5.0` branch. This branch contains content for the latest patch release of version 5.0.

=== Snapshot Releases

Add the new snapshot version to the following:

[cols="1m,1m,1m,1m"]

=== Patch Releases

In the `v/` branch for the minor version whose patch you are releasing, update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file to the new patch version. For example, if you are releasing version 5.0.3, find the `v/5.0` branch and update the `asciidoc.attributes.full-version` field in the `antora.yml` file with 5.0.3.

NOTE: As soon as you push content to this branch, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

=== Creating Release Branches

. If you are releasing a new major version, create a release branch from the `main` branch.
+
For example, if you are releasing version 5.1, create a new release branch named `5.1` from the `main` branch.

. Update the fields mentioned in <<latest-releases, Latest Releases>>.

. Remove the `prerelease: true` field and `snapshot: true` field from the docs/`antora.yml` file of the `management-center-docs` repository.
+
IMPORTANT: If you are creating a branch for a beta release, do not remove the `prerelease: true` field.

. When you are ready to release, create a maintentance branch from the release branch.
+
NOTE: As soon as you push the maintenance branch to the repository, GitHub will trigger a new build of the site, which will include your new content.

. Make sure to delete the release branch.
+
For example, if you released version `5.1`, delete the `5.1` branch. This step helps to keep the repository clean of release branches.

== GitHub Actions

To automate some elements of the build process, this repository includes the following GitHub Actions:

.GitHub Actions
[cols="m,a,a"]

|Validates that all internal and external links are working
|On a pull request to the `master`, `archive`, and `v/` branches

|build-site.yml
|Builds the production documentation site by sending a build hook to Netlify (the hosting platform that we use)
|On a push to the `master` branch and any `v/` branches
