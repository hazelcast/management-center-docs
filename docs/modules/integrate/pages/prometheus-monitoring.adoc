= Prometheus monitoring
:description: Prometheus is an open source monitoring system for metrics. You can export Hazelcast cluster metrics to a scrape endpoint in Management Center that Prometheus can consume. This allows you to monitor Hazelcast along with your other applications in the same monitoring tool.

{description}

Management Center's Prometheus Exporter automatically updates with any cluster changes and allows you to collect metrics easily for the whole cluster, or multiple clusters, from a single endpoint. Without it, you would have to scrape each member individually, manage any changes from scaling, restarts, and IP configuration, and collate the metrics from all members.

== Enable the Prometheus Exporter

To start exposing metrics via the Prometheus Exporter, set the `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled` system property to `true`.

Metrics are exposed to the `/metrics` endpoint, which is the Prometheus default. The endpoint provides metrics for all clusters that Management Center is connected to.

NOTE: Management Center also reformats the metrics to align with Prometheus best practice recommendations. See xref:prometheus-metrics.adoc[] for details.

== Disable timestamps

Management Center collects metrics with the timestamp of individual members, and sends this timestamp to Prometheus. Prometheus discards metrics with the oldest timestamps. You can disable sending timestamps so that your monitoring system continues to operate when clock shifts happen in the cluster.

To stop sending timestamps to Prometheus, set the <<prometheus-timestamp, `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.timestamp.enabled`>> property to `false`.

== Configure Prometheus

After enabling the Prometheus Exporter, you can configure your Prometheus YAML file to scrape metrics from Management Center.

TIP: For guidance, see the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config[Prometheus configuration documentation].

To allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from Management Center, set the `static_configs.targets` parameter to the URL of your Management Center instance.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'HZ MC'
    # scheme defaults to HTTP.
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:8080'] # replace this address with the network address of Hazelcast Management Center
----

=== Authenticate the scrape endpoint

To secure the scrape endpoint, you can set up basic authentication.

To do this, use the `set prometheus-auth` task of the `hz-mc conf` tool. Replace the `<my-user>` and `<my-pass>` placeholders with your chosen username and password.

[tabs]
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--
```bash
hz-mc conf set prometheus-auth <my-user> <my-pass>
```
--
Windows::
+
--
```bash
mc-conf.bat set prometheus-auth <my-user> <my-pass>
```
--
====

Then, add the credentials to the `basic_auth` parameter of the Prometheus YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
  - job_name: 'HZ MC'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:8080']
    basic_auth:
      username: my-user
      password: my-pass
----

=== Reset the authentication credentials

To reset authentication credentials for the scrape endpoint, use the `security reset` task of the `hz-mc conf` tool. You must stop Management Center to apply this change.

WARNING: This task will also delete all users from the database.

[tabs]
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--
```bash
hz-mc conf security reset
```
--
Windows::
+
--
```bash
mc-conf.bat security reset
```
--
====

== Filter metrics

By default, Management Center exports all metrics that are reported by the cluster.

To filter the metrics that are exposed to the scrape endpoint, use the `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.included`
and `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.excluded` system properties.

For example, this configuration exposes only the following metrics:

- `hz_topic_totalReceivedMessages`
- `hz_map_totalPutLatency`

[tabs]
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
hz-mc start -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true \
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.included=hz_topic_totalReceivedMessages,hz_map_totalPutLatency
----
--
Windows::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mc-start.cmd -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true ^
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.included=hz_topic_totalReceivedMessages,hz_map_totalPutLatency
----
--
====

This configuration exposes all metrics except the following:

- `hz_os_systemLoadAverage,hz_memory_freeHeap`

[tabs]
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
hz-mc start -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true \
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.excluded=hz_os_systemLoadAverage,hz_memory_freeHeap
----
--
Windows::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mc-start.cmd -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true ^
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.excluded=hz_os_systemLoadAverage,hz_memory_freeHeap
----
--
====

NOTE: As described in xref:prometheus-metrics.adoc[], Management Center reformats metrics to align with Prometheus best practice recommendations. Filtering matches against metrics in any format. For example, if you exclude `map.getCount`, you will exclude `hz_map_getCount` and `hazelcast_map_operations_total`.

== Override the default port

By default, metrics are exposed on the same port as the Management Center web interface. To
override the port number, use the `-Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.port` system property.

[tabs]
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
hz-mc start -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true \
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.port=2222
----
--
Windows::
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mc-start.cmd -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true ^
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.port=2222
----
--
====

In this example, the Prometheus endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:2222/metrics`. To allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from Management Center, make sure to set the `static_configs.targets` parameter to this port.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'HZ MC'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:2222']
----

== Visualize metrics in Grafana

Grafana is an open source data visualization solution that allows you to build monitoring dashboards from your Prometheus metrics. To start visualizing Prometheus metrics in Grafana, refer to the link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/get-started-grafana-prometheus/[Grafana documentation]. Hazelcast provides an https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13183[example dashboard] to help you get started.
