= Prometheus Monitoring
:description: You can export cluster metrics to a scrape endpoint in Management Center that Prometheus can consume. By collecting cluster metrics in Prometheus you can monitor Hazelcast along with your other applications in the same monitoring tool.

{description}

== Enabling the Prometheus Exporter

To start exposing metrics to Prometheus, set the `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled` system property to `true`.

Metrics are exposed to the `/metrics` endpoint, which is the default Prometheus metrics path.

NOTE: All metrics are exported with the `hz_` prefix.

== Configuring Prometheus

After enabling the Prometheus exporter, you can configure your Prometheus YAML file to scrape metrics from Management Center.

TIP: For guidance, see the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config[Prometheus configuration docs].

To allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from Management Center, set the `static_configs.targets` parameter to the URL of your Management Center instance.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'HZ MC'
    # scheme defaults to HTTP.
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:8080'] # replace this address with the network address of Hazelcast Management Center
----

=== Authenticating the Scrape Endpoint

To secure the scrape endpoint, you can set up basic authentication.

To set up basic authentication, use the `set prometheus-auth` task of the `mc-conf` tool. Replace the `<my-user>` and `<my-pass>` placeholders with your chosen username and password.

[tabs]
====
Linux and macOS::
+
--
```bash
mc-conf.sh set prometheus-auth <my-user> <my-pass>
```
--
Windows::
+
--
```bash
mc-conf.bat set prometheus-auth <my-user> <my-pass>
```
--
====

Then, add the credentials to the `basic_auth` parameter of the Prometheus YAML file:

[source,yaml]
----
  - job_name: 'HZ MC'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:8080']
    basic_auth:
      username: my-user
      password: my-pass
----

=== Resetting the Authentication Credentials

To reset authentication credentials for the scrape endpoint, use the `security reset` task of the `mc-conf` tool.

WARNING: This task will also delete all users from the database.

[tabs]
====
Linux and macOS::
+
--
```bash
mc-conf.sh security reset
```
--
Windows::
+
--
```bash
mc-conf.bat security reset
```

== Filtering Metrics

By default, Management Center exports all metrics that are reported by the cluster.

To filter the metrics that are exposed to the scrape endpoint, use the `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.included`
and `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.excluded` system properties.

For example, this configuation exposes only the following metrics:

- `hz_topic_totalReceivedMessages`
- `hz_map_totalPutLatency`

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true \
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.included=hz_topic_totalReceivedMessages,hz_map_totalPutLatency \
  -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

This configuation exposes all metrics except the following:

- `hz_os_systemLoadAverage,hz_memory_freeHeap`

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true \
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.filter.metrics.excluded=hz_os_systemLoadAverage,hz_memory_freeHeap \
  -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

== Overriding the Default Port

By default, metrics are exposed on the same port as the Management Center web interface. To
override the port number, use the `-Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.port` system property.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.enabled=true \
  -Dhazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.port=2222 \
  -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

In this example, the Prometheus endpoint will be available at `http://localhost:2222/metrics`. To allow Prometheus to scrape metrics from Management Center, make sure to set the `static_configs.targets` parameter to this port.

[source,yaml]
----
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'HZ MC'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:2222']
