= Prometheus metrics
:description: Management Center automatically reformats all Hazelcast cluster metrics for compatibility with Prometheus. In addition, Management Center updates a subset of metrics to align with Prometheus best practice recommendations. This makes it easier to construct complex queries, build dashboards, and work alongside metrics from other applications.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

By default, Management Center exposes two versions of metrics:

* *Version 1 (V1) Metrics.* Take the metrics exposed by xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast::list-of-metrics.adoc[Hazelcast's JMX metrics system] and applies the following transformation to each of the metric names:
** Substitutes `.` for `_`
** Adds the prefix `hz_`
* *Version 2 (V2) Metrics.* _Currently in BETA_. Take the metrics exposed by xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast::list-of-metrics.adoc[Hazelcast's JMX metrics system] but applies transformation to their names so that they conform with link:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/[Prometheus naming conventions]:
** Use `snake_case`
** Add `hazelcast_` prefix
** Update metric names where appropriate
** Combine related metrics and add labels
** Convert to recommended base units:
** Time in seconds
** Memory in bytes
** Percentages as ratios (for example, 50% converts to 0.5)
** Append units to metric names
** Remove unit labels
** Append `_total` to accumulated metrics


The following examples illustrate the differences between the V1 and V2 metrics.

* Rename and remove `unit` label, add `_total` suffix:
+
```
# V1
hz_map_queryCount{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="COUNT",} 0.0 1737715903399
# V2
hazelcast_map_queries_total{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",} 0.0 1737715903399
```

* Rename and append unit, remove `unit` label, convert value (1.7x10^12^ milliseconds to 1.7x10^9^ seconds):
+
```
# V1
hz_map_creationTime{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 1.737715861118E12 1737715903399
# V2
hazelcast_map_creation_timestamp_seconds{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",} 1.737715861118E9 1737715903399
```

* Rename and append unit, remove `unit` label, add `remove` label:
+
```
# V1
hz_map_totalMaxRemoveLatency{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 0.0 1737715903399
# V2
hazelcast_map_latency_max_seconds{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",operation="remove",} 0.0 1737715903399
```

* Rename, append unit suffix and `_total` suffix, remove `unit` label, add `remove` label, convert value from milliseconds to seconds:
+
```
# V1
hz_map_totalPutLatency{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 2019.0 1743601193973
# V2
hazelcast_map_latency_seconds_total{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",operation="put",} 2.019 1743601193973
```

[[config]]
== Configuring the metrics version

To change which set of metrics is exposed to Prometheus, update the `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers` system property:

* V1: `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers=V1`
* V2: `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers=V2`
* V1 and V2 (default): `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers=V1,V2`

See xref:deploy-manage:system-properties.adoc[].

IMPORTANT: If you set the property to `V2`, Management Center will only expose the subset of metrics that have updated versions available.

== Metrics list

Management Center converts all metrics for the `map`, `set` and `list` data structures. The full xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast::list-of-metrics.adoc[list of Hazelcast metrics] is provided in the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

In some cases, several V1 metrics are combined into a single V2 metric differentiated by labels. For example, `hazelcast_map_operations_total` replaces `hz_map_getCount` and `hz_map_setCount` by adding `operation="get"` and `operation="set"` labels.
