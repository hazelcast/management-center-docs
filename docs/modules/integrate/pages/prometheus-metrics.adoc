= Prometheus metrics
:description: Management Center automatically reformats all Hazelcast cluster metrics for compatibility with Prometheus. In addition, Management Center updates a subset of metrics to align with Prometheus best practice recommendations. This makes it easier to construct complex queries, build dashboards, and work alongside metrics from other applications.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

By default, Management Center exposes both the original metrics and the updated versions. Existing integrations will therefore continue to work, but you should consider the original metrics deprecated and plan to migrate to the updated versions. You can optionally xref:config[change which set of metrics is exposed].

== Metrics changes

Management Center makes the following changes to metrics exposed by Hazelcast clusters.

Original metrics:

* Convert `.` to `_`
* Add `hz_` prefix

Updated metrics:

* Use `snake_case`
* Add `hazelcast_` prefix
* Update metric names where appropriate
* Combine related metrics and add labels
* Convert to recommended base units:
** Time in seconds
** Memory in bytes
** Percentages as ratios (for example, 50% converts to 0.5)
* Append units to metric names
* Remove unit labels

The updated metrics are based on link:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/[Prometheus conventions].

The following examples illustrate the differences between the original and updated metrics.

* Rename and remove `unit` label:
+
```
hz_map_queryCount{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="COUNT",} 0.0 1737715903399

hazelcast_map_queries{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",} 0.0 1737715903399
```

* Rename and append unit, remove `unit` label, convert value (1.7x10^12^ milliseconds to 1.7x10^9^ seconds):
+
```
hz_map_creationTime{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 1.737715861118E12 1737715903399

hazelcast_map_creation_timestamp_seconds{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",} 1.737715861118E9 1737715903399
```

* Rename and append unit, remove `unit` label, add `remove` label:
+
```
hz_map_totalMaxRemoveLatency{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 0.0 1737715903399

hazelcast_map_latency_max_seconds{name="map-1",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",operation="remove",} 0.0 1737715903399
```

== Choose which set of metrics to use

To change which set of metrics is exposed to Prometheus, update the `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers` system property:

NOTE: The updated (V2) metrics are currently in BETA.

* Original only: `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers=V1`
* Updated only: `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers=V2`
* Both (default): `hazelcast.mc.prometheusExporter.printers=V1,V2`

See xref:deploy-manage:system-properties.adoc[].

IMPORTANT: If you set the property to `V2`, Management Center will only expose the subset of metrics that have updated versions available.

== Metrics list

Management Center converts all metrics for the `map`, `set` and `list` data structures. The full link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/list-of-metrics[list of Hazelcast metrics] is provided in the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

In some cases, several original metrics are combined into one and differentiated by labels. For example, `hazelcast_map_operations_total` replaces `hz_map_getCount` and `hz_map_setCount` by adding `operation="get"` and `operation="set"` labels.
