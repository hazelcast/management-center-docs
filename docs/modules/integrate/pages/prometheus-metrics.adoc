= Prometheus metrics
:description: Management Center automatically reformats Hazelcast cluster metrics to align with Prometheus best practice recommendations. This makes it easier to construct complex queries, build dashboards, and work alongside metrics from other applications.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

Management Center makes the following changes to metrics exposed by Hazelcast clusters:

* Use `snake_case`
* Change prefix from `hz_` to `hazelcast_`
* Update metric names where appropriate
* Implement labels
* Convert to recommended base units:
    * Time in seconds
    * Memory in bytes
    * Percentages as ratios (for example, 50% converts to 0.5)

The updated metrics are based on link:https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/[Prometheus conventions].

NOTE: By default, both the old and new metrics are exposed. Existing integrations will continue to work, but you should consider the old metrics deprecated and plan to migrate to the new metrics. You can optionally TODO: config.

The following examples show the differences between the old and new metrics.

* Rename and remove `unit` label:
+
```
hz_map_queryCount{name="concreteSubclassWithNestedCollection",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="COUNT",} 0.0 1737715903399

hazelcast_map_queries{name="concreteSubclassWithNestedCollection",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",} 0.0 1737715903399
```

* Rename, remove `unit` label, convert value (1.7^12^ milliseconds to 1.7^9^ seconds):
+
```
hz_map_creationTime{name="concreteSubclassWithNestedCollection",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 1.737715861118E12 1737715903399

hazelcast_map_creation_timestamp_seconds{name="concreteSubclassWithNestedCollection",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",} 1.737715861118E9 1737715903399
```

* Rename, remove `unit` label, add `remove` label:
+
```
hz_map_totalMaxRemoveLatency{name="concreteClass",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",unit="MS",} 0.0 1737715903399

hazelcast_map_latency_max_seconds{name="concreteClass",mc_member="127.0.0.1:5701",mc_cluster="Cluster-1",operation="remove",} 0.0 1737715903399
```

== Metrics list

Management Center converts all metrics for the `map`, `set` and `list` data structures. The full link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/list-of-metrics[list of Hazelcast metrics] is provided in the Hazelcast Platform documentation.
