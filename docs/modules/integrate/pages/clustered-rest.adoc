== Enabling Clustered REST

The REST API is disabled by default.

To enable clustered REST in Management Center, use the
xref:deploy-manage:system-properties.adoc#hazelcast-mc-rest-enabled[`hazelcast.mc.rest.enabled` property] at startup.

== Root Endpoint

The entry point for the clustered REST API is `/rest`. This
resource does not have any attributes.

== Parameters

All parameters that are used in the REST endpoints, such as
cluster names and distributed data structure names, must be
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[URL encoded].
Such parameters are marked in braces (`{` and `}`) in the URL description
for each endpoint. For example, `name.with/special@chars`
parameter value would be encoded as `name.with%2Fspecial%40chars`.

If no data can be
found for an endpoint, that endpoint returns a 404 HTTP status code.

== Authentication

Unless the security provider is set to dev mode, users need an authentication (auth) token to send requests to the REST API.

The auth token must be included in the following header:

* Authorization: Bearer <user_auth_token>

=== Generating Auth Tokens

The way in which you generate an auth token depends on the security provider that you use. See xref:deploy-manage:security-providers.adoc[].

NOTE: All auth tokens inherit roles from the user.

|===
|Security Provider| Method for issuing tokens

|Local Security Provider
|
Use the `user issue-token` task of the `hz-mc conf` tool.

Send a `POST` request to the `/api/tokens` endpoint.

Use Auth `Settings/API` screen on the UI.

|All other security providers other than dev mode
|
Send a `POST` request to the `/api/tokens` endpoint.

Use Auth `Settings/API` screen on the UI.

|===

==== Using `api/tokens` Endpoint

To use the /api/tokens endpoint for security providers except SAML and OIDC, run the following command. Replace the <username> and <password> placeholders with the credentials of a user logged in to the Management Center.

[source,bash]
----
curl -u <username>:<password> -d '{"username":"<username>"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tokens
----
To use the /api/tokens endpoint for SAML and OIDC, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
curl -d '{"username":"<username>"}' -H "X-CSRF-TOKEN: <x-csrf-token>" -H "Cookie: <cookie>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tokens
----

Here, replace the `<username>` placeholders with the username of a user logged in to the Management Center, and replace the `<x-csrf-token>` and `<cookie>` with X-CSRF-TOKEN and Cookie headers. You can get the headers from any request on Network tab in Developer Tools when you are logged into Management Center:

==== Using `hz-mc conf` Tool
To use the `hz-mc conf` tool, do the following:

[tabs] 
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
hz-mc conf user issue-token -n <username>
----
--
Windows::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
mc-conf.bat user issue-token -n <username>
----
--
====

The created token is displayed in the output:

```
Successfully issued a token for user 'test_user'.
Token: 'mJMMDfaSWZ1MuqhmGhA8m4erCNZtPi_A4_VyR_y8eH0'
Label: 'test_user_2021-07-07T17:24 EEST'
```

==== Using Auth Token Management UI

. Click *Settings* in the Top Bar.
. Navigate to the *API* tab.
+
image:ROOT:AuthTokenManagementPage.png[alt=Auth Token Management Page, align="center"]

. Select the user that you want to create a token for. Only admin can create tokens for other users.

. Enter the label of the token that you want to create. Default value has the `username_creationTime` format.
. Click *Create Token*.

You will see the created token on the right side.

image:ROOT:AuthTokenManagementPage_createdToken.png[alt=Created Token, align="center"]

You can copy your token to the clipboard.

NOTE: The token will not be displayed again, so make sure you note it before leaving the page or creating a new one.

You can see the list of existing tokens in the table, bottom of the page.

|===
|Field|Description

|Time Issued
|Date and time when the token was created.

|User
|Username which the token is created for.

|Token Label

=== Revoking All Auth Tokens

To revoke all auth tokens for a user, use the `user revoke-tokens` task.

[tabs]
====
Linux and Mac::
+
--

[source,bash]
----
hz-mc conf user revoke-tokens -n <username>

mc-conf.bat user revoke-tokens -n <username>

== OpenAPI Definitions

The Clustered REST endpoints are documented in OpenAPI format. See the following:

- xref:client-filtering.adoc[]
- xref:cluster-metrics.adoc[]
- xref:cluster-connections.adoc[]
- xref:wan-replication.adoc[]

This documentation is also accessible at the `/swagger-ui/index.html` endpoint of Management Center. For example `\http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`.
