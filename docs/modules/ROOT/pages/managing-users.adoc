To add a user to the system, specify the username, e-mail and password in the
**Add/Edit User** part of the page. Then provide the user's
privilege status using the checkboxes under `Permissions`:

* **Admin**: Select if the user to be added will have
the administrator privileges.
* **Read/Write**: If this permission is given to the user, *Home*,
*Scripting*, *Console* and *Documentation* items will
be visible. The users with this permission can update a map configuration
and perform operations on the members.
* **Read**: If this permission is given to the user, only *Home* and
*Documentation* items will be visible at the toolbar on
that user's session. Also, the users with this permission cannot update a
xref:monitor-cluster:monitor-dds.adoc#managing-maps[map configuration], run a garbage collection and take
a thread dump on a cluster member, or shutdown a member (see the
xref:monitor-cluster:monitor-members.adoc[Monitoring Members section]).
* **Metrics Only**: If this permission is given to the user, only *Home* and
*Documentation* items will be visible at the toolbar on
that user's session. Also, the users with this permission cannot
xref:monitor-cluster:monitor-dds.adoc#managing-maps[browse a map] or a cache to see their contents, cannot
update a xref:monitor-cluster:monitor-dds.adoc#map-config[map configuration], run a garbage collection
and take a thread dump on a cluster member, or shutdown a member
(see the xref:monitor-cluster:monitor-members.adoc[Monitoring Members section]).

After you enter/select all the fields, click on the **Save** button to create the user.
You will see the newly created user's username on the right side, in the
**List of Users** part of the page.

To edit or delete a user, click on its username listed in the **List of Users**.
Selected user information
appears on the left side of the page. To update the user information,
change the fields as desired
and click on the **Save** button; note that you can
only change the username and/or its privilege.

You can also change a user's password
or delete the user account. To
change the user's password, click on the **Change Password** button
while editing the user. To
delete the user from the system,
click on the **Delete** button. Note that changing the password of a user
and deleting the user account
both require you to enter your own password.

NOTE: Certain user management operations are also available via the MC Conf tool.
See the xref:mc-conf.adoc[Management Center Configuration Tool section] for more information.
