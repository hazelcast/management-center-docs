= Managing Security Providers

In case you selected the *Dev Mode* as the security provider when you first launched Management Center, then it is possible to
switch to an other security provider using the *Security Providers* tab in the *Settings* menu:

Important: this is a one-time option, you can change the security provider via the Management Center UI only if you currently
use *Dev Mode*. Due to security considerations, any subsequent changes to the security provider configuration is only available via
the xref:mc-conf.adoc[Management Center Configuration Tool].
