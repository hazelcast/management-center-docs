= Managing Security Providers

In case you selected the `Dev Mode` as the security provider when you first launched Management Center, then it is possible to
switch to an other security provider using the `Security Providers` tab in the `Settings` menu:

Important: this is a one-time option, you can change the security provider via the Management Center UI only if you currently
use `Dev Mode`. Due to security considerations, any subsequent changes to the security provider configuration is only available via
the xref:mc-conf.adoc[Management Center Configuration Tool].
