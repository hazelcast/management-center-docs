[[high-availability]]

Multiple Management Center instances can connect to the same cluster to ensure availability and eliminate a single
point of failure for management and monitoring purposes.

NOTE: Multiple Management Center instances are independent of each other and don't form a cluster of Management Center
instances.

This has the following implications:

 . It's up to you to maintain consistent configurations on all Management Center instances. Only Client Filtering
configuration is synchronized among Management Center instances.
 . Inconsistencies in the reported metrics are possible, for instance if one of the instances goes down for some time.
 . HTTP sessions are not shared between Management Center instances. Load balancing options are limited to:
 * sticky session;
 * round-robin with Basic Auth;

== Client Filtering Synchronization
Client filtering configuration for a cluster is synchronized among all Management Center instances connected to the
cluster. The synchronization happens on the *deploy* action. It is triggered by the following:

 * clicking on the **DEPLOY CONFIGURATION** button
 * creating/updating/deleting a list that is active and matches the deployed type
(*Allow-list* or *Deny-list*)

NOTE: The *deploy* action on a Management Center instance overrides the client filtering configuration for this cluster
on another instance and vice versa.

When Management Center connects to a cluster that already has some client filtering configuration
deployed, then Management Center saves the client filtering configuration from the cluster to the local persistent
storage. The previous configuration stored in Management Center is overwritten.

When another Management Center instance deploys a new client filtering configuration, then a message "Client filtering
configuration was updated by another Management Center instance" is displayed and blocks "Client Filtering Settings" and
"Filter Lists" are automatically refreshed.
