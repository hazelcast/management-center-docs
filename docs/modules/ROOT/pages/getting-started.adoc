== Management Center via Docker

The easiest way to start using Management Center is to run the official Management Center Docker image.
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
----
Please see more details at link:https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/management-center[DockerHub].

== Downloading Management Center

To start using the Management Center without Docker:

. Download the Hazelcast Management Center package.
. Start the Management Center service.
. Launch the Management Center user interface.

Hazelcast Management Center is included in the Hazelcast download package.
You can download it from the https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/downloads/#hazelcast-imdg[download page]
of the Hazelcast website.

When a new version of Hazelcast is released, it comes with a compatible version of Management Center.

There may be times when a new Management Center version is released before a new
version of Hazelcast. In that case, you may download the new Management Center
from its https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/downloads/#hazelcast-management-center[download page] as a
separate package.

== Using SNAPSHOT versions

If you need to use the most recent development version of Management Center, then you can run it by using the `latest-snapshot`
tag in Docker:
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --pull=always hazelcast/management-center:latest-snapshot
----

Alternatively, you can download it from https://download.hazelcast.com/management-center/management-center-latest-snapshot.zip .

In these cases, it can be useful to query the build information to be able to tell what revision are you using.

=== Getting Build Information

You can find version metadata about a running instance of Management Center at the following endpoint: `{mc-base-url}/api/buildInfo`.

This endpoint returns JSON.

== Starting the Management Center Service

You have the following options to start the Management Center service:

* Start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line.
* Use the scripts that come with the download package.
* Deploy the file `hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.war` on your Java application server/servlet container.

For all the starting options you can preconfigure a cluster in Management Center by setting the following environment variables:

* `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS` variable should contain a comma-separated list of the cluster member addresses.
* `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER` variable should contain the cluster name and defaults to `dev` if not provided.

[[starting-with-jar-file]]
=== Using the Command Line

Extract the Hazelcast or Management Center package.
The extracted directory, i.e., `hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}`,
contains the `hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar` file.

You can start this file directly from the command line using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

The above command starts the  Hazelcast Management Center service on port 8080 with the root context path (`\http://localhost:8080`).

You can use `-Dhazelcast.mc.http.port` and `-Dhazelcast.mc.contextPath`
command line options to start Management Center on a different port and
context path:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.http.port=8083 -Dhazelcast.mc.contextPath='hazelcast-mc' -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

The above command starts Management Center on port `8083` and context path `hazelcast-mc`.
You can access it by opening `\http://localhost:8083/hazelcast-mc` in your browser.

The next step is to let Management Center know the Hazelcast cluster member addresses
as explained in the xref:connecting-members.adoc[Connecting to the Clusters chapter].

For the options you can provide when starting with the
command line, see xref:configuring.adoc[Configuring Management Center].
For example, you can learn about topics including how to start with a
license or extra classpath, how to configure the security,
disk usage, update interval or logging.

[[deploying-to-application-server]]
=== Deploying to Application Server

Instead of starting at the command line, you can
deploy the Management Center to your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

[[starting-with-scripts]]
=== Using Scripts in the Package

As another option, you can use the `start.bat` or `start.sh` scripts,
which come with the download package in `bin/` folder, to start the Management Center.
You can find these scripts under the extracted directory.

== Quick Launch

After the above steps are completed, let's quickly open
Management Center with the default settings.

Assuming that you have started your Hazelcast clusters each including a single member on 
your local machine (localhost) and started the Management Center service on `\http://localhost:8080`,
follow the below instructions:

. Go to `\http://localhost:8080` using your preferred browser.
+. Select *Dev Mode* as the security provider, and click *Enable* (note: this configuration is not recommended for production
environments as it skips the requirement for login credentials)
. This will take you to the *Cluster Connections* page.  Click on the blue *+* button to define the connection Management Center will use to your Hazelcast cluster:
.. Fill in the *Cluster Name* (this needs to be an exact match.  `dev` is the default Cluster name)
.. Fill in one or more of the members' address details.  If the cluster is running on your laptop, then this will be `localhost`.
.. Click on the *Connect* button to save the configuration and connect to the cluster.
. On the *Cluster Connections* page, click the *View Cluster* button to go to that cluster's dashboard as shown below:

See xref:launching:launching.adoc[Launching the Management Center User Interface] for more details.

See the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:getting-started:install-hazelcast.adoc[Hazelcast documentation] for information on starting Hazelcast clusters.

Further details on the **Dev Mode** option for development or evaluation purposes that provides quick access to Management Center without requiring any security credentials, see
the xref:launching:dev-mode.adoc[Dev Mode section] for details.
