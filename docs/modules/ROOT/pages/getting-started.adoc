= Getting Started
[[deploying-and-starting]]

To start using the Management Center:

. download the Hazelcast Management Center package
. start the Management Center service
. launch the Management Center user interface.

== Downloading Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center is included in the Hazelcast IMDG download package.
You can download it from the https://hazelcast.org/download/#imdg[download page]
of Hazelcast's website.

When a new Hazelcast IMDG version is released, it comes with a Management Center
that is compatible with IMDG.
There may be times when a new Management Center version is released before a new
version of Hazelcast IMDG. In that case, you may download the new Management Center
from its https://hazelcast.org/download/#management-center[download page] as a
separate package.

== Starting the Management Center Service

You have the following options to start the Management Center service:

* Start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line.
* Use the scripts that come with the download package.
* Deploy the file `hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.war` on your Java application server/servlet container.

[[starting-with-jar-file]]
=== Using the Command Line

After you downloaded, extract the Hazelcast IMDG or Management Center package.
The extracted directory, i.e., `hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}`,
contains the `hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar` file.

You can start this file directly from the command line using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

The above command starts the  Hazelcast Management Center service on
the port `8080` with the root context path (`\http://localhost:8080`).

NOTE: In Management Center 4.0, the default context path changed from
`hazelcast-mancenter` to the root context path.

You can use `-Dhazelcast.mc.http.port` and `-Dhazelcast.mc.contextPath`
command line options to start Management Center on a different port and
context path:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.http.port=8083 -Dhazelcast.mc.contextPath='hazelcast-mc' -jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

The above command starts Management Center on port `8083` and context path `hazelcast-mc`.
You can access it by opening `\http://localhost:8083/hazelcast-mc` in your browser.

Then, you need to let Management Center know the Hazelcast IMDG member addresses
as explained in the xref:connecting-members.adoc[Connecting to the Clusters chapter].

For the options you can provide when starting with the
command line, see the xref:configuring.adoc[Configuring Management Center chapter].
In that chapter, you can learn about topics including how to start with a
license or extra classpath, how to configure the security,
disk usage, update interval or logging.

[[deploying-to-application-server]]
=== Deploying to Application Server

Instead of starting at the command line, you can
deploy the Management Center to your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

[[starting-with-scripts]]
=== Using Scripts in the Package

As another option, you can use the `start.bat` or `start.sh` scripts,
which come with the download package in `bin/` folder, to start the Management Center.
You can find these scripts under the extracted directory.

== Quick Launch

After the above steps are completed, let's quickly open the
Management Center user interface with the default settings.

Assuming that you have started your Hazelcast IMDG and Jet clusters
each including a single
member on your local machine (`localhost`) and started the Management Center service on `\http://localhost:8080`,
follow the below instructions:

. Go to `\http://localhost:8080` using your preferred browser.
. Select `Dev Mode` as the security provider, and click `Save` (note: this configuration is not recommended for production
environments).
. Login with your newly created credentials, and "Manage Clusters" page appears.
. Click on the "Add Cluster Config" button to connect Management Center to your IMDG cluster:
.. Click on the `Save` button after
providing your IMDG cluster's name and member address (`localhost`).
. Again, click on the "Add Cluster Config" button to connect Management Center to your Jet cluster:
.. Click on the `Save` button after
providing your Jet cluster's name (use the default `jet`) and member address (`localhost`).
. On the "Manage Cluster" page, click on the `Select` button for a desired cluster to monitor it; the dashboard of your cluster appears as shown below:

See the xref:launching:launching.adoc[Launching the Management Center User Interface chapter] for more details.

Also see xref:imdg:starting-members-clients.adoc[here] and link:https://jet-start.sh/docs/get-started/installation[here^] for information on starting the IMDG and Jet clusters, respectively.

You also have the **Dev Mode** option for development or evaluation purposes that provides
quick access to Management Center without requiring any security credentials. See
the xref:launching:dev-mode.adoc[Dev Mode section] for details.
