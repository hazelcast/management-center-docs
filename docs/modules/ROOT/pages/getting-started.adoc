= Getting Started
[[deploying-and-starting]]

The easiest way to start using Management Center is to run the official Management Center Docker image.
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center
----
Please see more details at link:https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/management-center[DockerHub].

To start using the Management Center without Docker:

. download the Hazelcast Management Center package
. start the Management Center service
. launch the Management Center user interface.

== Downloading Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center is included in the Hazelcast download package.
You can download it from the https://hazelcast.org/download/#hazelcast-imdg[download page]
of Hazelcast's website.

When a new Hazelcast version is released, it comes with a Management Center
that is compatible with Hazelcast.
There may be times when a new Management Center version is released before a new
version of Hazelcast. In that case, you may download the new Management Center
from its https://hazelcast.org/download/#hazelcast-management-center[download page] as a
separate package.

== System Requirements

Most Linux distributions are supported, assuming that glibc 2.12 or newer is installed.

Experimental support for AIX is provided as well, with the following prerequisites:
 * AIX version is 7.2 or newer
 * [AIX Toolbox](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/aix-toolbox-linux-applications-overview) is installed
 * glibc version is 2.17 or newer
 * JRE 1.8 or newer is installed
 * libsnappy 1.8.0 or newer is installed

== Starting the Management Center Service

You have the following options to start the Management Center service:

* Start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line.
* Use the scripts that come with the download package.
* Deploy the file `hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.war` on your Java application server/servlet container.

For all the starting options you can preconfigure a cluster in Management Center by setting the following environment variables:

* `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS` variable should contain a comma-separated list of the cluster member addresses.
* `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER` variable should contain the cluster name and defaults to `dev` if not provided.

[[starting-with-jar-file]]
=== Using the Command Line

After you downloaded, extract the Hazelcast or Management Center package.
The extracted directory, i.e., `hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}`,
contains the `hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar` file.

You can start this file directly from the command line using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

The above command starts the  Hazelcast Management Center service on
the port `8080` with the root context path (`\http://localhost:8080`).

NOTE: In Management Center 4.0, the default context path changed from
`hazelcast-mancenter` to the root context path.

You can use `-Dhazelcast.mc.http.port` and `-Dhazelcast.mc.contextPath`
command line options to start Management Center on a different port and
context path:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.http.port=8083 -Dhazelcast.mc.contextPath='hazelcast-mc' -jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

The above command starts Management Center on port `8083` and context path `hazelcast-mc`.
You can access it by opening `\http://localhost:8083/hazelcast-mc` in your browser.

Then, you need to let Management Center know the Hazelcast cluster member addresses
as explained in the xref:connecting-members.adoc[Connecting to the Clusters chapter].

For the options you can provide when starting with the
command line, see the xref:configuring.adoc[Configuring Management Center chapter].
In that chapter, you can learn about topics including how to start with a
license or extra classpath, how to configure the security,
disk usage, update interval or logging.

[[deploying-to-application-server]]
=== Deploying to Application Server

Instead of starting at the command line, you can
deploy the Management Center to your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

[[starting-with-scripts]]
=== Using Scripts in the Package

As another option, you can use the `start.bat` or `start.sh` scripts,
which come with the download package in `bin/` folder, to start the Management Center.
You can find these scripts under the extracted directory.

== Quick Launch

After the above steps are completed, let's quickly open the
Management Center user interface with the default settings.

Assuming that you have started your Hazelcast clusters
each including a single
member on your local machine (`localhost`) and started the Management Center service on `\http://localhost:8080`,
follow the below instructions:

. Go to `\http://localhost:8080` using your preferred browser.
. Select `Dev Mode` as the security provider, and click `Save` (note: this configuration is not recommended for production
environments).
. Login with your newly created credentials, and "Manage Clusters" page appears.
. Click on the "Add Cluster Config" button to connect Management Center to your Hazelcast cluster:
.. Click on the `Save` button after
providing your Hazelcast cluster's name and member address (`localhost`).
. On the "Manage Cluster" page, click on the `Select` button for a desired cluster to monitor it; the dashboard of your cluster appears as shown below:

See the xref:launching:launching.adoc[Launching the Management Center User Interface chapter] for more details.

Also see xref:imdg:ROOT:starting-members-clients.adoc[here] and link:{jet-docs}docs/get-started/installation[here^] for information on starting the Hazelcast clusters, respectively.

You also have the **Dev Mode** option for development or evaluation purposes that provides
quick access to Management Center without requiring any security credentials. See
the xref:launching:dev-mode.adoc[Dev Mode section] for details.
