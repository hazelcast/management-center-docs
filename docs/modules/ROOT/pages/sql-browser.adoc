This chapter details how a Hazelcast cluster can be queried with SQL using Management Center.

You can use the SQL browser for this purpose, which can be opened using
the "SQL Browser" menu item under the "Cluster" parent menu heading:

* Dropdown for selecting a map to quickly build a simple query
* Text field to enter or edit SQL queries
* **Execute Query** button
* **Clear Query Result** button
* **Query Result** tab
* **JSON View** tab
* **History** tab
* **Export as CSV** button

In the dropdown in the top left corner, you can choose one of the existing maps
in the cluster, and it prefills the text area with the following query:
`SELECT * FROM "<your-map-name>"`. You can execute the query by clicking
**Execute Query** button. Dropdown component supports textual search.

After a successful query execution, the contents of the **Query Result**,
**JSON View** and **History** tabs are rendered.

You can see the result of your query in the **Query Result** tab. You can click
on the **Export as CVS** button to export the query result as a CSV file in
a format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180]

You can click on the **Copy to Clipboard** button in the top right corner to copy
the result into your clipboard.

On the **History** tab, you can see the history of query execution. It holds last
one hundred executed queries. Each row contains **Execution Time**,
**Execution Status** and **Query** values. You can re-execute any query from the
history by pushing a button in the **Execute** column.
