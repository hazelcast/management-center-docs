[[sql_browser]]

This chapter details how a Hazelcast cluster can be queried with SQL using Management Center.

You can use the SQL browser for this purpose, which can be opened using
the "SQL Browser" menu item found in the top menu.

Once you select the SQL Browser menu item, the browser opens as shown below:

* Dropdown for selecting a map to quickly build a simple query
* Text field to enter or edit SQL queries
* **Execute Query** button
* **Clear Query Result** button
* **Query Results** tab
* **History** tab
* **Export as CSV** button

The dropdown above lists your maps and mappings providing sample queries. If a map in
your cluster does not have a mapping, selecting that map will insert an autogenerated `CREATE MAPPING`
statement into the editor. If your map already has a mapping, selecting that map will insert a `SELECT` statement into the editor.

You can execute the query by clicking
**Execute Query** button. Dropdown component supports textual search.

After a successful query execution, the contents of the **Query Result**,
**JSON View** and **History** tabs are rendered.

You can see the result of your query in the **Query Results** tab. You can click
on the **Export as CVS** button to export the query result as a CSV file in
a format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180]

the result into your clipboard.

On the **History** tab, you can see the history of query execution. It holds last
one hundred executed queries. Each row contains **Execution Time**,
**Execution Status** and **Query** values. You can re-execute any query from the
history by pushing a button in the **Execute** column.
