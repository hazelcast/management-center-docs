* Dropdown for selecting a map to quickly build a simple query
* Text field to enter or edit SQL queries
* **Execute Query** button
* **Clear Query Result** button
* **Query Result** tab
* **JSON View** tab
* **History** tab
* **Export as CSV** button

In the dropdown in the top left corner, you can choose one of the existing maps
in the cluster, and it prefills the text area with the following query:
`SELECT * FROM "<your-map-name>"`. You can execute the query by clicking
**Execute Query** button. Dropdown component supports textual search.

**JSON View** and **History** tabs are rendered.

You can see the result of your query in the **Query Result** tab. You can click
on the **Export as CVS** button to export the query result as a CSV file in
a format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180]

On the **History** tab, you can see the history of query execution. It holds last

**Execution Status** and **Query** values. You can re-execute any query from the
history by pushing a button in the **Execute** column.
