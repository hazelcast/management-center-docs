[[sql_browser]]

This chapter details how a Hazelcast cluster can be queried with SQL using Management Center. (Please see the xref:hazelcast:sql:sql-statements.adoc[SQL Statements section] of the Hazelcast documentation for details about SQL queries.)

You can use the SQL browser for this purpose, which can be opened using
the *SQL Browser* menu item found in the top menu.

Once you select the *SQL Browser* menu item, the browser opens as shown below:

* Dropdown for selecting a map to quickly build a simple query
* Text field to enter or edit SQL queries
* **Execute Query** button
* **Clear Query Result** button
* **Query Results** tab
* **History** tab
* **Export as CSV** button

To query a map, select its name from the dropdown. If the map does not have a mapping, an autogenerated `CREATE MAPPING` statement will be inserted into the editor. If the map already has a mapping, an autogenerated `SELECT` statement will be inserted into the editor.

To execute the autogenerated query, click
**Execute Query** button.

After a successful query execution, the contents of the **Query Result**,
**JSON View** and **History** tabs are rendered.

You can see the result of your query in the **Query Results** tab. You can click
on the **Export as CVS** button to export the query result as a CSV file in
a format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180]

On the **JSON View** tab, you can see the same data represented in JSON format.
You can click on the **Copy to Clipboard** button in the top right corner to copy
the result into your clipboard.

On the **History** tab, you can see the history of query execution. It holds last
one hundred executed queries. Each row contains **Execution Time**,
**Execution Status** and **Query** values. You can re-execute any query from the
history by pushing a button in the **Execute** column.
