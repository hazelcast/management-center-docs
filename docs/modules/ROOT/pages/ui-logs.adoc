= User Interface Logs

Using the *UI Logs* page of the *Settings* menu,
you can see the log entries related to the Management
Center user interface. This page looks like the following:

image:ROOT:SettingsUILogs.png[User Interface Logs]

This is basically useful to make the troubleshooting easier
related to the issues in the user interface. You can see the
timestamp and type of each log entry.

You can reorder the entries by their timestamps any types, and
also filter them by entering a keyword in the *Data* field such as
"auth", "map" and "session".

You can pause the log flow using the *Pause* button,
copy the log entries to the clipboard using the *Copy* button
(so that the entries can be examined in detail)
and resume the flow using the *Resume* button on the page.

NOTE: You may only need to share the information in these logs
if requested by the Hazelcast's support team.
