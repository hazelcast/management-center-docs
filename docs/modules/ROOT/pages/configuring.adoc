= Configuring Management Center
[[configuring]]

This chapter explains how you can configure Hazelcast Management Center according to your needs
if you are running it without Docker. For the Docker configuration please see
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/management-center[DockerHub].

The communication between
the Hazelcast cluster members and the Management Center instance is based
on Hazelcast open binary client link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/protocol/1.0-developer-preview/client-protocol-implementation-guide.html[protocol^]. The clusters that Management Center
should connect to are configured within Management Center as described in the
xref:connecting-members.adoc[Connecting Management Center to Hazelcast Members chapter].

NOTE: In previous versions, the URL of the Management Center instance was
configured within the `<hazelcast></hazelcast>` section of `hazelcast.xml`.
This configuration is now deprecated and ignored.

[[starting-with-a-license]]
== Providing a License

When starting the Management Center from the command line, a
license can be provided using the system property `hazelcast.mc.license`.
For example by using the command line parameter:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+",specialchars"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.license=<key> -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

When this option is used, the license provided takes precedence
over any license set and stored previously using the user interface.
Previously stored licenses are not affected and will be used again
when the Management Center is started without the `hazelcast.mc.license` property.
This also means no new license can be stored when the property is used.

[[starting-with-an-extra-classpath]]
== Providing an Extra Classpath

You can also start the Management Center with an extra classpath
entry (for example, when using JAAS authentication) by using the
following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -cp "hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar:/path/to/an/extra.jar" com.hazelcast.webmonitor.Launcher
----

On Windows, the command becomes as follows (semicolon instead of colon):

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -cp "hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar;/path/to/an/extra.jar" com.hazelcast.webmonitor.Launcher
----

[[client-config]]
== Configuring the Client Used by Management Center

You can configure the client instance that is used for connecting to the cluster
by using the following command line parameters:

- `-Dhazelcast.mc.client.initial.backoff.millis`: Duration, in milliseconds, to wait after the first
failure before retrying. It is in milliseconds. The default value is `1000` ms.
Set values have to be in range of `1000` to `60000` ms.
- `-Dhazelcast.mc.client.backoff.multiplier`: Factor with which to multiply backoff after
a failed retry. Default value is `2`. Set values have to be in range of `1` to `10`.
- `-Dhazelcast.mc.client.max.backoff.millis`: When backoff reaches this upper bound,
it does not increase any more. It is in milliseconds. Default value is `32000` ms.
Set values have to be in range of `32000` to `600000` ms.

Note that these parameters apply to all clients that are started by Management Center.

You can also pass in a custom client configuration file to Management Center. These parameters
override any configuration you pass as part of adding a new cluster connection. Following is a list
of all other client configuration parameters that are overriden by Management Center when creating
clients to connect to clusters:

- `InstanceName`: Generated based on the cluster name.
- `ConnectionStrategyConfig.asyncStart`: Set to `true`. It means that the client starts without
waiting to get a cluster connection.
- `ConnectionStrategyConfig.clusterConnectTimeoutMillis`: Set to infinity. The client
never gives up trying to connect to the cluster.
- `NetworkConfig.smartRouting`: Set to `true`. It means that client will open connections to all
members.

[[metadata-polling-config]]
== Configuring Metadata Polling Period of Management Center

Management Center polls the cluster members periodically for their metadata, which includes the
list of data structures it has and their configurations. You can change the polling frequency by
using the `hazelcast.mc.state.reschedule.delay.millis` command line parameter. Its default value
is `1000`.

[[disk-usage-config]]
== Configuring Disk Usage

You can control the disk space used by the Management Center to avoid exceeding
available disk space. That can be done by configuring the xref:metric-persistence.adoc[Metrics Persistence].

You can use the `hazelcast.mc.metrics.disk.ttl.duration` system property
to configure the Management Center's metrics persistence. This property
specifies Time-to-Live (TTL) setting for each record in the metrics persistence.
It is in ISO-8601-based durations format that supports days, hours, minutes, seconds and its default value is `P1D` (one day).

[TIP]
====
`hazelcast.mc.metrics.disk.ttl.duration` can be expressed using the following format, where `(n)` is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the `(n)`:

`P(n)DT(n)H(n)M(n)S`, where

- `P` is the duration designator (referred to as "period"), and is always placed at the beginning of the duration.
- `D` is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.
- `T` is the time designator that precedes the time components.
- `H` is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
- `M` is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
- `S` is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

For example:

`P4DT12H30M5S`

Represents a duration of four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds.
====

It is important to understand that the TTL setting acts as a _soft_ limit and
gives you an indirect control over Management Center disk usage. The final
disk usage depends on the volume of metrics persistence data generated by your clusters, i.e.,
the number of cluster members and data structures with enabled statistics that
you have in the connected clusters.

NOTE: You may want to decrease the TTL setting in situations when the Management
Center uses too much disk space.

[[enabling-health-check-endpoint]]
== Enabling Health Check Endpoint

When running the Management Center from the command line, you can enable
the Health Check endpoint. This endpoint responds with `200 OK` HTTP
status code once the Management Center web application has started. The
endpoint is available on port `<Management Center HTTP port> + 1` with
context path `<Management Center context path>/health` (by default, its
URL is `\http://localhost:8081/health`). Note that the
HTTP protocol is always used for the Health Check endpoint, independently
of TLS/SSL settings, and no additional authentication is enforced for it.

If you want to enable the Health Check endpoint, use the following command line argument:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.healthCheck.enable=true
```

== Restricting the Bind Address

You can configure the bind address for Management Center so that it is not reachable on any network address
using the `-Dhazelcast.mc.hostAddress` system property. Example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.hostAddress=127.0.1.1 -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

With this setting, Management Center will be reachable on `http://127.0.1.1:8080` but won't listen on
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

[[configuring-sessions]]
== Configuring Sessions

This section provides information on how to configure the Management Center
sessions for various aspects including timeouts and login/logout operations.

[[configuring-session-timeout]]
=== Configuring Session Timeout

If you have started the Management Center from the command line
by using the JAR file, by default, the sessions that are inactive for
30 minutes are invalidated. To change this, you can use the
`-Dhazelcast.mc.session.timeout.seconds` command line parameter.

For example, the following command starts the Management Center with
a session timeout period of 1 minute:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.session.timeout.seconds=60 -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

If you have deployed the Management Center on an application
server/container, you can configure the default session timeout
period of the application server/container to change the session
timeout period for the Management Center. If your server/container
allows application specific configuration, you can use it to configure
the session timeout period for the Management Center.

[[disabling-multiple-simultaneous-login-attempts]]
=== Disabling Multiple Simultaneous Login Attempts

Normally, a user account on the Management Center can be used from
multiple locations at the same time. If you want to forbid
others from logging in, when there's already someone logged in with the
same username, you can start the Management Center with
the `-Dhazelcast.mc.allowMultipleLogin=false` command line parameter.

[[disable-login-configuration]]
=== Disable Login Configuration

In order to prevent password guessing attacks, logging in is
disabled temporarily after a number of failed login attempts. When
not configured explicitly, the default values are used, i.e., logging
in is disabled for 5 seconds when a username is failed to log in
consecutively 3 times. During this 5 seconds of period, logging in is
not allowed even when the correct credentials are used. After 5 seconds,
the user will be able to log in using the correct credentials.

Assuming the configuration with the default values, if the failed
attempts continue (consecutively 3 times) after the period of disabled
login passes, this time the disable period is multiplied by 10:
logging in is disabled for 50 seconds. The whole process repeats
itself until the user logs in successfully. By default, there's no upper
limit to the disable period, but can be configured by using the
`-Dhazelcast.mc.maxDisableLoginPeriod` parameter.

Here is a scenario, in the given order, with the default values:

. You try to login with your credentials consecutively 3 times but failed.
. Logging in is disabled and you have to wait for 5 seconds.
. After 5 seconds have passed, logging in is enabled.
. You try to login with your credentials consecutively 3 times but again
failed.
. Logging in is disabled again and this time you have to wait for 50
seconds until your next login attempt.
. And so on; each 3 consecutive login failures causes the disable
period to be multiplied by 10.

You can configure the number of failed login attempts, initial
and maximum duration of the disabled login and the multiplier
using the following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.failedAttemptsBeforeDisableLogin`: Number of failed
login attempts that cause the logging in to be disabled temporarily. Default
value is `3`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.initialDisableLoginPeriod`: Initial duration for the disabled
login in seconds. Default value is `5`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.disableLoginPeriodMultiplier`: Multiplier used for extending
the disable period in case the failed login attempts continue after disable
period passes. Default value is `10`.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.maxDisableLoginPeriod`: Maximum amount of time for the disable
login period.  This parameter does not have a default value. By default,
disabled login period is not limited.


[[forcing-logout-on-multiple-simultaneous-login-attempts]]
=== Forcing Logout on Multiple Simultaneous Login Attempts

If you haven't allowed multiple simultaneous login attempts explicitly,
the first user to login with a username stays
logged in until that username explicitly logs out or its session expires.
In the meantime, no one else can login with the same
username. If you want to force logout for the first user and let the
newcomer login, you need to start Management
Center with the `-Dhazelcast.mc.forceLogoutOnMultipleLogin=true` command
line parameter.

[[configuring-and-enabling-security]]
== Configuring and Enabling Security

This section provides information on how to use and manage the
Management Center with TLS/SSL and mutual authentication.
You will also learn how to force the users to specify passwords
that are hard to guess.

[[using-management-center-with-tlsssl-only]]
=== Using Management Center with TLS/SSL Only

To encrypt data transmitted over all channels of the Management Center
using TLS/SSL, make sure you do all of the following:

* Deploy the Management Center on a TLS/SSL enabled container or start it from
the command line with TLS/SSL enabled. See the <<enabling-tslssl-when-starting-with-jar-file, Enabling TLS/SSL section>> below.
** Another option is to place the Management Center behind a TLS-enabled
reverse proxy. In that case, make sure your reverse proxy sets the necessary
HTTP header (`X-Forwarded-Proto`) for resolving the correct protocol.
* Enable TLS/SSL communication to the Management Center for your Hazelcast
cluster. See the xref:connecting-members.adoc[Connecting Members chapter].
* If you're using Clustered JMX on the Management center, enable TLS/SSL
for it. See xref:jmx:jmx.adoc[Enabling TLS/SSL for Clustered JMX section].
* If you're using LDAP authentication, make sure you use LDAPS or
enable the *Start TLS* field. See the xref:launching:auth-options.adoc[LDAP Authentication section].
* If you're using Active Directory authentication, make sure you use Java's
truststore related system properties. See the xref:launching:auth-options.adoc[Active Directory Authentication section].

NOTE: You can configure how Management Center treats `X-Forwarded-*`
headers using the system property `hazelcast.mc.forwarded.requests.enabled`.
If its value is set to `true`, Management Center accepts and treats them
as set by a reverse proxy in front of it, otherwise, they are ignored.
Its default value is `true`.

[[enabling-tslssl-when-starting-with-jar-file]]
=== Enabling TLS/SSL When Starting with JAR File

When you start the Management Center from the command line, it serves
the pages unencrypted by using "http", by default. To enable TLS/SSL,
use the following command line parameters when starting the Management Center:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled`: Specifies whether TLS/SSL is enabled. Its default value is false (disabled).
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore`: Path to the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword`: Password of the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore`: Path to the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.

You can leave the truststore and truststore password values empty to use
the system JVM's own truststore.

The following is an example on how to start the Management Center with
TLS/SSL enabled from the command line:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/some/dir/selfsigned.jks
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

You can access the Management Center from the following HTTPS URL on
port 8443: `\https://localhost:8443`.

On the member side, you need to configure the Management Center URL
as `\https://localhost:8443` and also set the
following JVM arguments when starting the member:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path to your truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword
```

NOTE: If you plan to use a self-signed certificate, make sure
to create a certificate with the hostname of the machine you will
deploy the Management Center on. Otherwise, you will see a line similar
to the following in the member logs:

```
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException:
No subject alternative names matching IP address 127.0.0.1 found
```

To override the HTTPS port, you can use the `-Dhazelcast.mc.https.port`
command line option when starting the Management Center. For example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/dir/to/certificate.jks \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=yourpassword \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.https.port=443 \
     -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

This starts the Management Center on HTTPS port 443.

NOTE: You can encrypt the keystore/truststore passwords and pass them
as command line arguments in encrypted form for improved security.
See the xref:configuring.adoc#variable-replacers[Variable Replacers section] for more information.

[[enabling-http-port]]
==== Enabling HTTP Port

By default, HTTP port is disabled when you enable TLS. If you want to
have an open HTTP port that redirects to the HTTPS port, use the following
command line argument:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enableHttpPort=true
```

[[managing-tls-enabled-clusters]]
==== Managing TLS Enabled Clusters

If a Hazelcast cluster is configured to use TLS for communication between
its members using a self-signed certificate, the Management Center will not be
able to perform some of the operations that use the cluster's HTTP endpoints
(such as shutting down a member or getting the thread dump of a member). This is
so because self-signed certificates are not trusted by default by the JVM. For
these operations to work, you need to configure a truststore containing the public
key of the self-signed certificate when starting the JVM of the Management Center using
the following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStore`: Path to the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default
value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm
based on which the authentication keys are provided. System default is used
if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.

NOTE: You can encrypt the truststore password and pass it as a command line
argument in encrypted form for improved security. See the
xref:configuring.adoc#variable-replacers[Variable Replacers section] for more information.

By default, JVM also checks for the validity of the hostname of the
certificate. If this test fails, you will see a line similar to the
following in the Management Center logs:

```
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: java.security.cert.CertificateException:
No subject alternative names matching IP address 127.0.0.1 found
```

If you want to disable this check, start the Management Center with
the following command line parameter:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.disableHostnameVerification=true
```

[[mutual-authentication]]
=== Mutual Authentication

You can configure Management Center to require mutual authentication. With this setup,
any client (be it a Web browser or an HTTP client such as curl) needs to present their TLS
certificate and the Management Center needs to have its truststore configured so that the
Management Center can know which clients it can trust. To enable mutual authentication,
you need to use the following command line parameters when starting the Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication=REQUIRED
```

See the below snippet to see the full command to start the Management Center:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStore=path to your truststore \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.trustStorePassword=password for your truststore \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication=REQUIRED \
     -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

The parameter `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.mutualAuthentication` has two options:

* `REQUIRED`: If the client does not provide a keystore or the provided keys are
not included in the Management Center's truststore, the client will not be authenticated.
* `OPTIONAL`: If the client does not provide a keystore, it will be authenticated.
But if the client provides keys that are not included in the Management Center's truststore,
the client will not be authenticated.

[[managing-mutual-authentication-enabled-clusters]]
==== Managing Mutual Authentication Enabled Clusters

If mutual authentication is enabled for the cluster,
the Management Center needs to have a keystore to identify itself.
For this, you need to start the Management Center with the
following command line parameters:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStore`: Path to the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStorePassword`: Password of the keystore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. Its default value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.httpClient.tls.keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication
keys are provided. System default is used if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.

[[excluding-specific-tlsssl-procotols]]
==== Excluding Specific TLS/SSL Protocols

When you enable TLS on the Management Center, it will support the clients
connecting with any of the TLS/SSL protocols that the JVM supports by default.
In order to disable specific protocols, you need to set the `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols`
command line argument to a comma separated list of protocols to be excluded from the
list of supported protocols. For example, to allow only TLSv1.2, you need to add
the following command line argument when starting the Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols=SSLv3,SSLv2Hello,TLSv1,TLSv1.1
```

When you specify the above argument, you should see a line similar
to the following in the Management Center log:

```
2017-06-21 12:35:54.856:INFO:oejus.SslContextFactory:Enabled Protocols
[TLSv1.2] of [SSLv2Hello, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2]
```

[[using-openssl]]
==== Using OpenSSL

To use OpenSSL with Management Center, you need to add
the following command line argument when starting the Management Center:

```
-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.openSsl=true
```

When you specify the above argument, Management Center uses https://github.com/google/conscrypt/[Google's Conscrypt SSL]
that is built on their fork of OpenSSL, BoringSSL.

NOTE: If you are using Java 8 and your JVM doesn't support TLSv1.3, you must exclude
TLSv1.3 protocol by passing `-Dhazelcast.mc.tls.excludeProtocols="TLSv1.3"` command line argument.
We recommend that you upgrade your JVM to the latest version of Java 8. Many vendors
including Oracle and AdoptOpenJDK (Eclipse Adoptium as its new name) support TLSv1.3
in their latest Java 8 implementations.

[[using-a-dictionary-to-prevent-weak-passwords]]
=== Using a Dictionary to Prevent Weak Passwords

In order to prevent certain words from being included in the user
passwords, you can start the Management Center with `-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.path`
command line parameter which points to a text file that contains a word
on each line. As a result, the user passwords will not contain any dictionary
words, making them harder to guess.

The words in the dictionary need to be at least three characters long in order to
be used for checking the passwords. The shorter
words are ignored to prevent them from blocking the usage of many password
combinations. You can configure
the minimum length of words by starting the Management Center with
`-Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.minWordLength`
command line parameter and setting it to a number.

An example to start the Management Center using the aforementioned parameters
is shown below:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.path=/usr/MCtext/pwd.txt \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.security.dictionary.minWordLength=3 \
     -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

[[including-excluding-specific-cipher-suites]]
=== Including and/or Excluding Specific Cipher Suites

When you configure TLS you also can provide which cipher suites Management Center can use
for establishing TLS connection. You can include cipher suites with `-Dhazelcast.mc.include.cipher.suites`
and exclude with `-Dhazelcast.mc.exclude.cipher.suites` system properties during
Management Center startup. You can use the exact cipher suite name or a regular expression.
For example:
```
"-Dhazelcast.mc.include.cipher.suites=^SSL_.*$"
"-Dhazelcast.mc.exclude.cipher.suites=^.*_(MD5|SHA|SHA1)$,^TLS_RSA_.*$,^.*_NULL_.*$"
```

[[configuring-logging]]
== Configuring Logging

Starting with version 4.2020.11, Management Center uses https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j 2]
for its logging. By default, it uses the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----

logger.flywaydb.additivity = false
logger.flywaydb.appenderRef.rolling.ref = STDOUT

logger.hikari.name = com.zaxxer.hikari
logger.hikari.level = ${sys:hazelcast.mc.log.level:-warn}

logger.springerror.appenderRef.rolling.ref = STDOUT

rootLogger.level = ${sys:hazelcast.mc.log.level:-info}
rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT
----

To change the logging level for all loggers, e.g., enabling debug logs, you can start
Management Center with `-Dhazelcast.mc.log.level` command line option. For example, to enable
debug logs, start Management Center with `-Dhazelcast.mc.log.level=debug` command line parameter.

To further customize the logging configuration, you can create a custom
Log4j configuration file and start Management Center with
the `-Dlog4j.configurationFile` option pointing to your configuration file.

For example, you can create a file named `log4j2-custom.properties` with the following
content and set logging level to `DEBUG`.
To use this file as the logging configuration, you need to start Management Center with the
`-Dlog4j.configurationFile=/path/to/your/log4j2-custom.properties` command line parameter:

[source,properties]
----
appender.console.type = Console
appender.console.name = STDOUT
appender.console.layout.type = PatternLayout
appender.console.layout.pattern = %d [%highlight{%5p}{FATAL=red, ERROR=red, WARN=yellow, INFO=green, DEBUG=magenta}] [%style{%t{1.}}{cyan}] [%style{%c{1.}}{blue}]: %m%n
appender.console.filter.threshold.type = ThresholdFilter
appender.console.filter.threshold.level = ${sys:hazelcast.mc.log.level:-all}

rootLogger.level = debug
rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = STDOUT
----

To write log messages into rolling log files (in parallel with printing them
into the console), you can use a similar Log4j configuration file:

[source,properties]
----
appender.console.type=Console
appender.console.name=STDOUT
appender.console.layout.type=PatternLayout
appender.console.layout.pattern=%d [%highlight{${LOG_LEVEL_PATTERN:-%5p}}{FATAL=red, ERROR=red, WARN=yellow, INFO=green, DEBUG=magenta}] [%style{%t{1.}}{cyan}] [%style{%c{1.}}{blue}]: %m%n

appender.rolling.type=RollingFile
appender.rolling.name=RollingFile
appender.rolling.fileName=${sys:user.home}/mc-logs/mc.log
appender.rolling.filePattern=${sys:user.home}/mc-logs/mc.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log
appender.rolling.layout.type=PatternLayout
appender.rolling.layout.pattern=%d [%5p] [%t] [%c{.1}]: %m%n
appender.rolling.policies.type = Policies
appender.rolling.policies.time.type = TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy

rootLogger.level=info
rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref=STDOUT
rootLogger.appenderRef.rolling.ref=RollingFile
----

=== Skipping Lock File Check

When you run `mc-conf.sh` or `mc-conf.bat`, the script checks if there is any running Management Center instance by looking for a lock file called `mc.lock` in the Management Center home directory, and exits with an error if the file exists. You can turn this behavior off by passing the `-Dhazelcast.mc.lock.skip=true` system property. Example:

[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_OPTS='-Dhazelcast.mc.lock.skip=true'
./mc-conf.sh ...
----

NOTE: This feature can be useful when you run Management Center on Kubernetes, and the home directory is on a mounted persistent volume. In this case when Kubernetes restarts the container for any reason, then the `mc.lock` file won't be deleted, therefore the next startup will be prevented due to the lock file, unless the `hazelcast.mc.lock.skip` system property is set to `true`.

=== Enabling Audit Logging

You may enable additional security audit logging by using the `-Dhazelcast.mc.auditlog.enabled=true`
command line argument. Log entries from the audit logging will be marked with the
`hazelcast.auditlog` logging category, abbreviated as `h.auditlog` in logs.

An example log entry looks like the following:

```
2020-10-13 09:57:54,803 [ INFO] [qtp973576304-35] [h.auditlog]: MC-2001 [Auth]:User logged in:{username=JohnHallaign}n}
```

`MC-2001 [Auth]` you see in this example represents the log's type.
The following table lists the current log categories along with their
types:

[[variable-replacers]]
== Using Variable Replacers

Variable replacers are used to replace custom strings during loading the configuration,
either passed as command line arguments, used during UI based Management Center configuration,
or configured with xref:mc-conf.adoc[Configuration tool].
They can be used to mask sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
Of course their usage is not limited to security related information.

Variable replacers implement the interface `com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.spi.ConfigReplacer`
and they are configured via the following command line arguments:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.class`: Full class name of the replacer.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.failIfValueMissing`: Specifies whether the loading
configuration process stops when a replacement value is missing. It is an optional
attribute and its default value is `true`.
* Additional command line arguments specific to each replacer implementation.
All of the properties for the built-in
replacers are explained in the upcoming sections.

The following replacer classes are provided by Hazelcast as example
implementations of the `ConfigReplacer` interface.
Note that you can also implement your own replacers.

* `EncryptionReplacer`
* `PropertyReplacer`

Each example replacer is explained in the following sections.

=== EncryptionReplacer

This example `EncryptionReplacer` replaces the encrypted variables with
its plain form. The secret key for encryption/decryption is generated from a
password which can be a value in a file and/or environment specific values,
such as MAC address and actual user data.

Its full class name is `com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.EncryptionReplacer`
and the replacer prefix is `ENC`. Here are the properties used to configure
this example replacer:

* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.cipherAlgorithm`: Cipher algorithm used for
the encryption/decryption. Its default value is AES.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.keyLengthBits`: Length (in bits) of the
secret key to be generated. Its default value is 128.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordFile`: Path to a file whose content
should be used as a part of the encryption password. When the property
is not provided, no file is used as a part of the password. Its default value is null.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordNetworkInterface`: Name of the network interface
whose MAC address should be used as a part of the encryption password. When the
property is not provided no network interface property is used as a part of the password.
Its default value is null.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordUserProperties`: Specifies whether
the current user properties (`user.name` and `user.home`) should be used
as a part of the encryption password. Its default value is true.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.saltLengthBytes`: Length (in bytes) of a
random password salt. Its default value is 8.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.secretKeyAlgorithm`:  Name of the secret key
algorithm to be associated with the generated secret key. Its default
value is AES.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.secretKeyFactoryAlgorithm`: Algorithm used
to generate a secret key from a password. Its default value is
PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256.
* `hazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.securityProvider`: Name of a Java Security
Provider to be used for retrieving the configured secret key factory and
the cipher. Its default value is null.

NOTE: Older Java versions may not support all the algorithms used as defaults.
Use the property values supported by your Java version.

As a usage example, let's create a password file and generate the encrypted strings out
of this file as shown below:

. Create the password file: `echo '/Za-uG3dDfpd,5.-' > /opt/master-password`
. Define the encrypted variables:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -cp hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordFile=/opt/master-password \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordUserProperties=false \
     com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.EncryptionReplacer \
     "aPasswordToEncrypt"

Output:

$ENC{wJxe1vfHTgg=:531:WkAEdSi//YWEbwvVNoU9mUyZ0DE49acJeaJmGalHHfA=}
----
+
. Configure the replacer and provide the encrypted variables as command
line arguments while starting the Management Center:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java \
 -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.class=com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.EncryptionReplacer \
 -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordFile=/opt/master-password \
 -Dhazelcast.mc.configReplacer.prop.passwordUserProperties=false \
 -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true \
 -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=/opt/mc.keystore \
 -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword='$ENC{wJxe1vfHTgg=:531:WkAEdSi//YWEbwvVNoU9mUyZ0DE49acJeaJmGalHHfA=}' \
 -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

=== PropertyReplacer

`PropertyReplacer` replaces variables by properties with the given name.
Usually the system properties are used, e.g., `${user.name}`.

Its full class name is `com.hazelcast.webmonitor.configreplacer.PropertyReplacer`
and the replacer prefix is empty string ("").

=== Implementing Custom Replacers

You can also provide your own replacer implementations. All replacers
have to implement the three methods that have the same signatures as
the methods of the following interface:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.Properties;

public interface ConfigReplacer {
    void init(Properties properties);
    String getPrefix();
    String getReplacement(String maskedValue);
}
