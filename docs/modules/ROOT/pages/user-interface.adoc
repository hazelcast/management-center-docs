= User Interface Overview
[[user-interface-overview]]

In this chapter, we briefly go over the toolbar and left menu items of the
user interface itself, regardless of which cluster we monitor (IMDG or Jet).
For now, you can ignore the body content which shows the cluster data. Those are
explained in the following chapters throughout this document.

The following is the Management Center user interface:

The user interface has a toolbar on the top and a menu on the left.

== Toolbar

The toolbar has the following elements:

* **Docs**: Opens the Management Center documentation in a new browser tab.
* **Console**: Opens the in-page console so that you can easily execute commands
in your cluster. See the <<console, Executing Console Commands chapter>>. Note that
this top menu item appears only when you select a cluster to monitor.
* **User name**: Shows the current user's name. When you hover your mouse cursor
onto it, the user's last login time is shown as a tooltip, for security purposes.
* **Cluster Selector**: Switches between the clusters. When clicked on, a dropdown
list of available clusters appears. You can select any cluster; once selected, the page immediately
loads with the selected cluster's information. This selector
has the same functionality as selecting a cluster in the "Manage Clusters" menu
of the user interface.
* **Logout**: Closes the current user's session.

[[menu]]
== Menu

The Management Center user interface includes a menu on the left which lists the
data structures and jobs in your clusters, cluster members and clients connected to
the cluster (numbers in square brackets show the instance count for each entity),
as shown below. You can also see an overview state of your cluster,
execute commands and scripts, and perform user/license operations using this menu:

NOTE: WAN Replication button is only visible with the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license.

The menu consists of the following parent menu headings:

* **MANAGEMENT CENTER**: Includes menu items to manage
clusters, user and license operations, and examine the
user interface logs.
* **JET**: Includes menu items to export snapshots and
manage Jet jobs.
* **CLUSTER**: Includes menu items for general cluster
operations, monitoring clients/cluster members and
executing scripts/commands.
* **STORAGE**: Includes menu items to monitor data structures
such as the maps, caches and PN counters in your cluster.
* **MESSAGING**: Includes menu items to monitor queues and
topics in your cluster.
* **COMPUTE**: Includes the "Executors" menu item to monitor
the executor services in your cluster.

NOTE: If you have not selected a cluster to monitor, only
the "Management Center" menu items are shown in the user
interface.

The following sections describe each menu item from top to bottom.
