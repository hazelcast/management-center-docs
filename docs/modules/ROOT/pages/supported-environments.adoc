[[supported-environments]]

You need Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or later to run Hazelcast Management Center.

Management Center uses RocksDB library to store metrics
data on disk. Because of that dependency, macOS users have to be on at least 10.15
version (Catalina) and Windows users need to have Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable
installed. Otherwise, you can use the official Management Center docker image.

== Hazelcast Compatibility

We officially support Hazelcast 5.0.x, any IMDG 4.y version that was released
before this Management Center version
and any Jet 4.3.z version.
