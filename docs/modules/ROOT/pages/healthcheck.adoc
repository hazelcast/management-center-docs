This feature can be accessed by clicking the corresponding menu item under the "Cluster" parent menu heading. The Health Check report compares and analyzes the effective member configurations across the cluster.

NOTE: Health Check is a licensed feature.

It performs the following checks:
 
 * if the maps, caches, queues, topics, reliable topics, serialization and security configuration sections are identical across members
 * if the backup reads are disabled for maps with TTL-based eviction
 * if the map query caches configured with batch updates have higher than 0 delay-seconds
 * if the map and query cache indexes are redundant
 * if the maps using native memory have proper eviction configurations
 * if the map custom attributes are unique per extractor
 * if the member operating system metrics are available

== Periodically running the Health Check

Starting from version 5.0, Management Center periodically runs the Health Check report, and displays the number of problems
found in a warning on the UI. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `-Dhazelcast.mc.periodic.healthcheck.enabled`
property to `false`.
