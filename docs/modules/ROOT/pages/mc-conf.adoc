= Management Center Configuration Tool
[[mc-conf]]

The Management Center Configuration Tool (MC-Conf) is a command
line tool that allows you to update certain parts of the Management Center
configuration by using its built-in tasks. You can use the `mc-conf.sh`
or `mc-conf.bat` script to run the MC-Conf tool from the `/bin/` folder.

NOTE: You must run the MC-Conf tool on the same machine where the Management Center web application is deployed.

NOTE: The Management Center must not be running when changes are made via MC-Conf.

NOTE: If you have used a non-default Management Center home directory location,
then you must provide the path to the home directory with the `-H` (or `--home`) option.

== Built-In Help

In order to see all available commands, run the MC-Conf script with no
arguments as shown below.

```bash
./bin/mc-conf.sh
```

As the result, you should see an output similar to below.

```bash

== Configuring Cluster Connection

The `cluster add` task adds a new connection configuration for a cluster.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes, and automatically configuring Management Center, without the need for a manual cluster connection configuration through UI.

[[mc-conf-create-user]]
== Creating Users

The `user create` task creates a new user in the Local security
provider. Note that you must stop the Management Center web application
before running this task.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes. See the
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker-samples[Hazelcast Docker Code Samples]
repository for an example of Docker image for the Management Center container with
a built-in user account.

NOTE: If you're on Linux or MacOS devices and provide value directly to `mc-conf`, please enclose password in single quotes like: `-p='mysecr3tp@s$word'`

== Changing User Password

The `user update-password` task resets the password of a specified user in
the Local security provider. Note that you must stop the Management Center
web application before running this task.

You can use this task as a recovery mechanism for the Management Center's
administrator user account.

NOTE: If you're on Linux or MacOS devices and provide value directly to `mc-conf`, please enclose password in single quotes like: `-p='mysecr3tp@s$word'`

== Configuring LDAP Security Provider

The `ldap configure` task configures the LDAP security provider.
Note that you must stop the Management Center web application, before running this task.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes and automatically configuring Management Center without the need for a manual security provider configuration through UI.

You can encrypt the LDAP password before saving with this task.
See the xref:configuring.adoc#variable-replacers[Variable Replacers section] for more information.

As with the UI based LDAP configuration, you can also use keystore for secure password storage, by using the optional `--key-store-*` options, as shown in the examples below.

If you want to use the built-in Management Center managed keystore, you can add the following options:
`--ks-create --key-store=<hazelcast-mc directory>/mc.jceks --key-store-password=<password>`.
This creates a keystore in the default Management Center directory, and saves the LDAP password in it.
If you want to customize the keystore name or Management Center directory when starting Management Center, you need to reflect that with the `--key-store=<path>` option.

If you want to use the existing externally managed keystore, you can use the following options:
`--key-store=<keystore path> --key-store-password=<password> [--key-store-type=<type> --key-store-provider=<provider>]`.
Note that if the keystore with such path doesn't exist, task fails.

NOTE: You still need to properly configure Management Center to use keystore.
See xref:launching:auth-options.adoc#password-encryption[LDAP Authentication section] for details on using the built-in and existing keystores.

[[mc-conf-update-ldap-password]]
== Updating LDAP Password

The `ldap update-password` task updates the encrypted LDAP password stored in
the keystore. It expects information about the keystore such as its location and
password and the new LDAP password that you want to use. See the
xref:launching:auth-options.adoc#password-encryption[LDAP Authentication section] for more information on the
encrypted LDAP passwords. After updating the LDAP password, you need to click
on the **Reload Security Config** button on the login page.

== Configuring Active Directory Security Provider

The `active-directory configure` task configures the Active Directory security provider.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes, and automatically configuring Management Center, without the need for a manual security provider configuration through UI.

== Configuring JAAS Security Provider

The `jaas configure` task configures the JAAS security provider.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes, and automatically configuring Management Center, without the need for a manual security provider configuration through UI.

== Configuring OpenID Connect Security Provider

The `oidc configure` task configures the OpenID Connect security provider.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes, and automatically configuring Management Center, without the need for a manual security provider configuration through UI.

== Configuring SAML Security Provider

The `saml configure` task configures the SAML security provider.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes, and automatically configuring Management Center, without the need for a manual security provider configuration through UI.

== Configuring Dev Mode Security Provider

The `dev-mode` configure task configures the Dev Mode security provider.

You can use this task for various scripting purposes, and automatically configuring Management Center, without the need for a manual security provider configuration through UI.

== Resetting Security Provider

The `security reset` task resets current security provider used in
the Management Center. For the Local security provider it also deletes all
built-in user accounts. Note that you must stop the Management Center web application
before running this task.

You can use this task as a recovery mechanism for the Management Center deployment in case if a non-Local security provider is configured.
In case of the Local security provider, you can also use the `user create` or `user update-password`
task as the recovery mechanism.

== Enabling/Disabling Metrics Persistence

The `set metrics-persistence-enabled` task lets you choose whether
metrics should be persisted to disk or not.

== Hiding Sensitive Configuration Properties

The `set sensitive-properties` task configures the sensitive properties that must not be shown in plain text in Management Center.
`--hidden-properties` is a comma-separated list of member properties to be hidden in the member properties.
`--masked-config-properties` is a comma-separated list of XPath expressions in the member configuration to be masked.

== Advanced Features

MC-Conf supports interactive options for secure processing of passwords.
To use it, you need to use the password option without providing a value, i.e., instead of
`--password=<password>` use `--password`.
When you use this option without providing a value, you will get a prompt to enter a value on the console.
An example of the interactive option usage is shown below.

```bash
./mc-conf.sh user update-password --username=admin --password
Enter value for --password (Password for the user record. Provide value directly,
or use without value to enter securely with interactive prompt.): ********
Successfully changed password for user 'admin'.

```

As you see in the above example, the password input is not echoed to the console
since it is provided with the secure interactive mode.

Another advanced feature of MC-Conf is the support for argument files. When an
argument beginning with the character `@` is encountered, it is treated as a path
leading to a text file. The contents of that file are automatically expanded into
the current task. An example of the argument file usage is shown below.

```bash
./mc-conf.sh user update-password @arg-file.txt
Successfully changed password for user 'admin'.
cat arg-file.txt
--username=admin --password=mnb3c4s0
```
