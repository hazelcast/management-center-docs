= Managing Clusters
[[managing-clusters]]

"Manage Clusters" is the first page that
appears after you login to Management Center for the first time.
It is used to add, remove or edit cluster configurations,
and looks like the following:

image:ROOT:StartingPage.png[alt=Starting Page, align="center"]

If you are using Management Center for the first time,
you need to add your cluster's configuration using this page
You can always go to this page during your Management Center usage
by clicking on the "Manage Clusters"
menu item under the "Management Center" parent
menu heading.

To start monitoring your cluster you have already created
(on your local machine, another development environment,
etc.) you need to first define a cluster
configuration to connect Management Center to your cluster.
After you click on the "Add Cluster Config" button
shown in the above screenshot,
you can do this by either of the following options:

* Using a form by providing the cluster name and member addresses
* Uploading a configuration file

== Creating a Cluster Configuration Using Form

Click on the "Add Cluster Config" button as seen in
the above screenshot. The following page appears:

image:ROOT:AddClusterConfig.png[alt=Add New Cluster Configuration]


* `Cluster Name`: Enter the name of your cluster, which was defined when the cluster was created.
(The default cluster name is `dev` for Hazelcast clusters) 
* `Cluster Config State`: Select "Enabled" to activate the cluster configuration.
You can also select "Disabled" which will 
create the cluster configuration in a deactivated state for use 
at a later time. Disabled cluster configurations are ignored until enabled.
* `Member Addresses`: Give the cluster members' addresses (one or preferably more)
in the form of `hostname`, `hostname:port`, `IP address` or `IP address:port`.
If no port is provided, the system tries the ports through 5701 and 5703 in a random order.
Type the member address and press enter (or return) to make it visible in the "Member Addresses" field.

NOTE: As soon as Management Center connects to one of the members,
it will auto-discover the other members of the cluster.
It is recommended to enter more than one member address in case that member
in the configuration is no longer available in the future.

Click on the `Save` button and the "Manage Clusters" page loads
with the new cluster configuration added, as shown below:

image:ROOT:ClusterConfAdded.png[alt=Cluster Configuration Added]

Here, you can see the state of the cluster and member count. Also,
at the top left of the cluster box, you see the green colored dot,
meaning that Management Center is connected to your cluster.

You can add multiple cluster configurations using the same mechanism
as explained above.

NOTE: When connecting to multiple clusters from the same Management Center,
please ensure that the cluster names are unique.  Management Center does not
support simultaneous connections to more than one cluster with the same cluster name.

The following page shows an example where Management Center
is and is not able to connect one of clusters:

You can edit or delete a cluster configuration using
the icons on any cluster's box area in this page.

To see the status of a cluster, click on its
`Select` button. Management Center internally decides
whether the selected one supports streaming, and
shows the related "Dashboard" page of that cluster. 

The "Dashboard" page of the
related cluster will load; see the xref:monitor-imdg:dashboard.adoc[Dashboard Page chapter]
for the details. Clicking on the `Select` button and
selecting a cluster in the cluster selector (located at the toolbar)
have the same functionality.

== Creating a Cluster Configuration by Uploading File

Alternatively, you can upload a configuration file for the
Management Center client created for your Hazelcast cluster. For this,
click on the `Upload Config File` button which is seen after
you click on the "Add Cluster Config" button. 

This is the recommended method for more complex configurations.

The following page appears:

image:ROOT:UploadConfigFile.png[alt=Upload Config File]

The name of your cluster will be automatically generated
as specified in the configuration file you upload. As mentioned
before in the xref:connecting-members.adoc[Connecting Members chapter],
you can think of Management Center as a client that connects to your Hazelcast cluster you create. Therefore,
this configuration file is a well-known `hazelcast.client` in XML or YAML language.

Here is an example configuration file:

.Example hazelcast-client.xml file
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/client-config"
                  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/client-config
                  http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/client-config/hazelcast-client-config-5.0.xsd">
    <cluster-name>dev</cluster-name>
    <network>
        <cluster-members>
            <address>127.0.0.1</address>
            <address>127.0.0.2</address>
        </cluster-members>
    </network>
</hazelcast-client>
----

You can simply drag this file onto the `Cluster Config File` box in this page,
or find it using the `browse` link in the same box.

Select "Enabled" in the `Cluster Config State` combobox to activate the configuration.
You can also select "Disabled" just to create the configuration and use it
at a later time. In this case, the configuration is ignored until enabled.

You can always go back to the form page (explained in the previous section)
by clicking on the `Add via Form` on this page.
