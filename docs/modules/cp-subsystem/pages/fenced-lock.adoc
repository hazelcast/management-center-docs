A fenced lock has two fixed metrics:

- *Acquire Limit*: Maximum number of reentrant acquires, which is configured in the CP member's xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc#fencedlock-configuration[`lock-acquire-limit`] option.
- *Lock Count*: Total number of times the lock has been acquired.

If lock is held by an endpoint, the following additional metrics are displayed:

- *Owner Session Id*: xref:dashboard.adoc#session[Session] ID of the lock owner.
- *Owner*: Address of the lock owner.

You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers.
