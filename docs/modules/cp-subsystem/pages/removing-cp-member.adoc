= Removing CP Members
:description: You can manually remove a disconnected CP member from the CP subsystem, using Management Center.

If a CP member loses connection with the rest of the cluster, the CP subsystem will wait for the 4 hours by default before connecting to a new CP member. You can configure this time in the `missing-cp-member-auto-removal-seconds` setting. See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc[] in the Platform documentation.
