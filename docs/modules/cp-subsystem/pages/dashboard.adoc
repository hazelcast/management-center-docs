== Status Banner

A banner is always displayed at the top of the page with a message about the current CP subsystem status.

This banner may display one of
the following messages:

* *CP Subsystem is not enabled*: The cluster is not configured with a CP member count of at least 3.
* *All CP members are accessible*: Number of accessible CP members is at least the same as the configured CP member count.
* *One CP member is not accessible*: One
CP member is missing and the minority count in the CP subsystem is greater than 1. For example, this value is shown
when 6 accessible CP members are available and the configured count is 7. In this example, the minority
count is 3 members and the majority count is 4 members.
* *Multiple CP members are not accessible:* Multiple
CP members are missing, but their count is less than the minority.
* *Minority of the CP members are not accessible:* The minority of CP
members are missing.
* *Majority of the CP members are not accessible:* The majority of CP
members are missing.

[[promote]]
== Promoting Members to CP Members

You can promote any existing member that is not part of the CP subsystem to a CP member.

This action is available only to admin users. 

. Go to *CP Subsystem* > *Dashboard*, and click *Promote*.

. Select an AP member (one of the members that do not participate in the CP subsystem) from the dropdown.
+
NOTE: Lite members are not displayed in the dropdown list because they do not store data and cannot be promoted to CP members.

If everything goes well, a success message is displayed.

If an exception occurs, an error notification is displayed.

[#remove]
== Removing CP Members

You can manually remove a disconnected CP member from the CP subsystem, using Management Center.

If a CP member loses connection with the rest of the cluster, the CP subsystem will wait for 4 hours by default before connecting to a new CP member. You can configure this time in the `missing-cp-member-auto-removal-seconds` option. See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:cp-subsystem:configuration.adoc[] in the Platform documentation.

This action is available only to admin users. 

. Go to *CP Subsystem* > *Dashboard*, and click *Remove*.

. Select a CP member from the dropdown.
+
Although this member is not connected to the Management Center, it is known by
the cluster's CP subsystem. 

If everything goes well, a success message is displayed.

If an exception occurs, an error notification is displayed.
[#restart]
== Restarting CP Subsystem

If the majority of CP members crash, you can restart the CP subsystem to delete all CP data and trigger a new round of the discovery process.

This action is available only to admin users. 

Go to *CP Subsystem* > *Dashboard*, and click *Restart*.

If everything goes well, a success message is displayed.

If an exception occurs, an error notification is displayed.
