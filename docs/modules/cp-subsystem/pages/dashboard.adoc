== Status Banner

A banner is always displayed at the top of the section with a message about the current CP subsystem status. This banner may display one of
the following messages:

* *CP Subsystem is not enabled*: The cluster is not configured with a CP member count of at least 3.
* *All CP members are accessible*: Number of accessible CP members is at least the same as the configured CP member count.
* *One CP member is not accessible*: One
CP member is missing and the minority count in the CP subsystem is greater than 1. For example, this value is shown
when there are 6 accessible CP members and the configured count is 7. In this example, the minority
count is 3 members and the majority count is 4 members.
* *Multiple CP members are not accessible:* Multiple
CP members are missing, but their count is less than the minority.
* *Minority of the CP members are not accessible:* The minority of CP
members are missing.
* *Majority of the CP members are not accessible:* The majority of CP
members are missing.
