== Current and Historical Data

Tables work in two modes - current and historical. It fetches current data in the current mode
and historical data in the historical mode.

The current mode is always available. The historical mode requires xref:deploy-manage:historical-metrics.adoc[] to be enabled.

The date/time input controls what data is displayed. The input is disabled if only current data is available.
You can select any arbitrary point in the past to see the historical data from that period. You can drag
the chart to adjust the time point.

Tables, by default, show up to 1 minute of data.
In the current mode it requests data in chunks every 5 seconds, and concatenates it.
In the historical mode it requests 1 minutes of data up to the selected time point once.

When the historical mode is activated, the date/time input displays the selected time point. You can press the *RESET TIME* button
to switch back to the current mode.

== Presets

Tables provide access to an extensive list of metrics
and use a selection of filters to show only relevant data matching a certain condition on the table.
A preset is a combination of metrics and a filter. You can add/edit new presets and remove the existing ones.
Each table is shipped with at least one default preset. You cannot edit or remove a default preset.

The top-right dropdown shows the name of the preset and allows you to switch between them. The delete button next to it deletes the selected preset.
The pencil and plus buttons open a dialog to edit the selected preset and to define a new preset, respectively.
