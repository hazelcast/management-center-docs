== Current and Historical Data

Tables work in two modes - current and historical. It fetches current data in the current mode
and historical data in the historical mode.

The current mode is always available. The historical mode requires xref:deploy-manage:historical-metrics.adoc[] to be enabled.

To see the current data, press the *RESET TIME* button. To switch to the historical mode, click on the field labeled as *Now* which opens the time selector:

You can either provide a time range using the *From* and *To* input fields, or select a preset range using the *LAST ...* buttons.
In the historical mode, the time input fields display the selected time range. The selected time range controls what data is displayed.
Providing time ranges is disabled if only current data is available for a table.

Tables, by default, show up to 1 minute of data. In the current mode it requests data in chunks every 5 seconds.
In the historical mode, it can request data up to 1 day depending on the provided time range.

== Presets

Tables provide access to an extensive list of metrics. You can customize the displayed columns of a table by defining presets to show only relevant data of your preference.
Each table is shipped with at least one default preset which cannot be edited or removed.

The top-right dropdown shows the name of the preset and allows you to switch between them. The delete button next to it deletes the selected preset.
The pencil and plus buttons open a dialog to edit the selected preset and to define a new preset, respectively. The following is an example which customizes the Map Statistics table to show
only the *Puts* and *Removals* columns.
