Top Bar has the following elements:

* *Cluster dropdown*: Select a connected cluster to manage. Cluster version is shown to the right of each connected cluster.

NOTE: During a xref:clusters:triggering-rolling-upgrade.adoc[rolling upgrade], all members can be, for instance, `5.2.z`, but the cluster is still `5.1`; in these cases, the cluster version is displayed as `5.1`. You can find more details on xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc#rolling-upgrade-procedure.adoc[Performing a Rolling Upgrade].

* *Cluster connections*: Navigate to xref:deploy-manage:connecting-to-clusters-ui.adoc[Cluster Connections] page to add new cluster connection.
* **Settings**: Configure the Management Center settings such as security providers, users, and licenses. See the *Deploy and Manage* section of the documentation.
* **Username** or *< > Dev Mode*: If you have configured a security provider, the last element displays the current user's name. You can click this name to sign out. Otherwise, this element displays *< > Dev Mode*.

Side Bar on the left-hand side contains the following elements:

* **Menu**: Open/close the menu on the left-hand side.

The menu on the left-hand side lists the
data structures and jobs in your clusters, cluster members and clients connected to
the cluster (numbers on the right show the instance count for each entity). You can also see an overall state of your cluster,
execute commands and scripts, and perform user/license operations using this menu.
The menu consists of the following parent menu headings:

* **Favorites**: Includes menu items that marked as favorite. You can add an item to Favorites, or remove an item from Favorites by
clicking the star icon to the left of the item.

operations, monitoring clients/cluster members and
executing scripts/commands.
* **Storage**: Includes menu items to monitor data structures
such as the maps, caches and PN counters in your cluster.

manage streaming jobs.
* **Compute**: Includes the *Executors* menu item to monitor
the executor services in your cluster.
* **Messaging**: Includes menu items to monitor queues and
topics in your cluster.
* **CP Subsystem**: Includes menu items to monitor CP members and data structures such as Atomic Longs, Semaphores, and Fenced Locks in your cluster.
