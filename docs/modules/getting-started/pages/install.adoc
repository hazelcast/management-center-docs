:description: This topic explains the options for installing and starting Management Center, using Docker or the binary packages.

{description}

== Before you Begin

xref:overview.adoc#requirements[Review the requirments] and make sure that you meet them.

== Using Docker

. link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Install Docker^].

. Check that Docker is correctly installed.
+
[source,bash]
----
docker version
----

. If you do not see a version number, see the link:https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/[Docker docs^] for troubleshooting information.

. Pull the Management Center Docker image from Docker Hub.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker pull hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
----
. Start the Management Center service
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
----

Please see more details at link:https://hub.docker.com/r/hazelcast/management-center[DockerHub].

== Using Binary Packages

Hazelcast Management Center is included in the Hazelcast download package.
You can download it from the https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/downloads/#hazelcast-platform[download page]
of the Hazelcast website.

When a new version of Hazelcast is released, it comes with a compatible version of Management Center.

There may be times when a new Management Center version is released before a new
version of Hazelcast. In that case, you may download the new Management Center
from its https://hazelcast.com/open-source-projects/downloads/#hazelcast-management-center[download page] as a
separate package.

If you choose to install Management Center using binary packages, you have the following options to start the Management Center service:

* Start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line.
* Use the scripts that come with the download package.
* Deploy the file `hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.war` on your Java application server/servlet container.

For all the starting options you can preconfigure a cluster in Management Center by setting the following environment variables:

* `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS` variable should contain a comma-separated list of the cluster member addresses.
* `MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER` variable should contain the cluster name and defaults to `dev` if not provided.

[[starting-with-scripts]]
=== Using Scripts in the Package

As another option, you can use the `mc-start scripts,
which come with the download package in `bin/` folder, to start the Management Center. You can find these scripts under the extracted directory.

[[starting-with-jar-file]]
=== Using the Command Line

Extract the Hazelcast or Management Center package.
The extracted directory (`hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}`)
contains the `hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar` file.

You can start this file directly from the command line using the following command:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

[[deploying-to-application-server]]
=== Deploying to Application Server

Instead of starting at the command line, you can
deploy the Management Center to your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).

== SNAPSHOT versions

If you want to use the most recent development (snapshot) version of Management Center, then you can run it by using the `latest-snapshot`
tag in Docker:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --pull=always hazelcast/management-center:latest-snapshot
----

Alternatively, you can download it from https://download.hazelcast.com/management-center/management-center-latest-snapshot.zip
or https://download.hazelcast.com/management-center/management-center-latest-snapshot.tar.gz .

In these cases, it can be useful to query the build information to be able to tell what revision are you using.
You can find version metadata about a running instance of Management Center at the following endpoint: `<hazelcast.mc.home>/api/buildInfo`.
This endpoint returns JSON.
