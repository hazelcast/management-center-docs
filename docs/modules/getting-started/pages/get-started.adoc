= Get Started with Management Center Using Docker Compose
:description: pass:q[In this tutorial, you'll start up an instance of Management Center that automatically connects to a Hazelcast cluster, using a Docker container. To get up and running as quickly as possible, an example `docker-compose.yml` is provided. No other configuration or dependencies are required.]

{description}

You'll complete the following steps:

* Create a `docker-compose.yml` to run a Hazelcast environment from a Docker container on your local machine.
* Start up Management Center and a Hazelcast cluster, using Docker Compose.
* Launch Management Center from a browser to view cluster details.
* Create a map using the SQL browser.
* Monitor the map.
* Shut down your Hazelcast environment.

== Before You Begin

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

|Docker Compose

|===

== Step 1. Run Hazelcast from a Docker Container

. Check that Docker Compose is installed correctly.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker compose version
----
+
If you do not see a version number, see the link:https://docs.docker.com/get-started/08_using_compose/[Docker docs] for troubleshooting information.

. Create a new directory on your local machine. In the directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and copy in the following details:
+
ifdef::snapshot[]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  hazelcast:
    image: hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version}
ports:
    - "5701:5701"
  management-center:
    image: hazelcast/management-center:latest
    ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    environment:
    - MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER=dev
    - MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS=hazelcast
----
endif::[]
ifndef::snapshot[]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  hazelcast:
    image: hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version}
    ports:
    - "5701:5701"
  management-center:
    image: hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
    ports:
    - "8080:8080"
    environment:
    - MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER=dev
    - MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS=hazelcast
----
endif::[]
+
You can preconfigure a cluster connection in Management Center by setting the following environment variables:

- MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER: The cluster name that Management Center connects to.
- MC_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_MEMBERS: A comma-separated list of the cluster member addresses or host names.

.	In a terminal, change into the directory that you just created.

. To pull the required images, and to start up a Management Center instance already connected to a Hazelcast cluster, run the following:
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker compose up
----
+
Wait until you see the following message in the console:
+
`Hazelcast Management Center successfully started at http://localhost:8080`
+
Followed by:
+
`MC Client connected to cluster dev.`

== Step 2. Launch Management Center

Now that Management Center is connected to a running cluster, you can start to explore.

. In a web browser, go to `localhost:8080`. Details of the Hazelcast cluster that Management Center connected to during startup are displayed.
+

+
Management Center is running in dev mode. This mode is a special security provider that allows you to evaluate Management Center, without needing login credentials or authentication tokens for the REST API. For details about security providers, see xref:deploy-manage:security-providers.adoc[].

. Click *View Cluster* to see the cluster's dashboard.
+

== Step 3. Create a Map

Management Center comes with a variety of tools for communicating with clusters. In this step, you'll use the SQL browser to create a map in the cluster and put some data in it.

. Click *SQL Browser* in the toolbar.
+
After each of the following SQL queries, click *Execute Query*.

. Create a map called `my_distributed_map`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING my_distributed_map TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----

. Put some data into the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO my_distributed_map VALUES
   ('1', 'John'),
   ('2', 'Mary'),
   ('3', 'Jane');
----

. Now you can query the data you have written:
+
----
SELECT * FROM my_distributed_map;
----

== Step 4. Monitor the Map

Go back to the cluster's dashboard and select *Storage* > *Maps* in Management Center, and then select *my_distributed_map*
from the list of maps. You can see the statistics of your map:

== Step 5. Shut Down Hazelcast

To shut down your Hazelcast environment gracefully, press CTRL+C.
