= Get Started with Management Center in Docker
:description: In this tutorial, you'll learn how to start Management Center, using Docker.

{description}

You'll complete the following steps:

* Start Management Center in dev mode on your local device.
* Connect Management Center to an existing Hazelcast cluster.
* Create a map using the SQL browser.
* Monitor the map.

== Before You Begin

== Step 1. Start Management Center

. Start Management Center.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
----
+
You should see the following terminal log:
+
`Hazelcast Management Center successfully started at http://localhost:8080`

. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 and enable *Dev Mode*.
+

This mode is a special security provider that allows you to evaluate Management Center, without needing login credentials or authentication tokens for the REST API. For details about security providers, see xref:deploy-manage:security-providers.adoc[].

== Step 2. Connect to the Cluster

. Click *Connect*.
+

. Enter the name of your cluster, and at least two members' IP addresses and ports.
+
We recommend entering more than one member address for fault tolerance.
+
You should see the established connection between Management Center and the cluster.

. Click *View Cluster* to see the cluster's dashboard.

== Step 3. Create a Map

Management Center comes with a variety of tools for communicating with clusters. In this step, you'll use the SQL browser to create a map in the cluster and put some data in it.

. Click *SQL Browser* in the toolbar.
+
After each of the following SQL queries, click *Execute Query*.

. Create a map called `my_distributed_map`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING my_distributed_map TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----

. Put some data into the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO my_distributed_map VALUES
   ('1', 'John'),
   ('2', 'Mary'),
   ('3', 'Jane');
----

== Step 4. Monitor the Map

Go to *Storage* > *Maps* in Management Center, and select *my_distributed_map*
from the list of maps. You can now see the statistics of your map:
