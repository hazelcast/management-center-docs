:description: Management Center is a powerful tool for managing and monitoring Hazelcast Platform clusters.

{description}

Management Center provides a user-friendly interface to monitor performance, view statistics, and perform administrative tasks.

== Key Features and Benefits

* *Monitoring and Performance Tracking*. Management Center allows you to monitor the performance of your clusters through its UI, JMX interface, and Prometheus integration. You can view detailed statistics about members, clients, and data structures in real-time, helping you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your applications.
* *Execute SQL queries on your clusters*. The SQL Browser feature enables you to execute SQL queries on your clusters. Management Center shows queryable objects with a schema and index explorer, and can handle streaming SQL queries, displaying the last 1,000 entries as they arrive.
* *Administrative Capabilities*. Management Center enables you to perform various administrative tasks such as:
** Identifying and diagnosing issues in clusters
** Implementing client filtering to control which clients can connect to a cluster
** Executing scripts to automate interactions with the cluster
** Taking thread dumps from nodes
** Updating map configurations 
* *High Availability*. Management Center supports high availability deployments where multiple Management Center instances can connect to the same cluster, eliminating a single point of failure for management and monitoring purposes. 
User Management with Role-Based Access Control. Management Center provides comprehensive role-based access control with different user roles (Admin, User, Read-Only, and Metrics-Only) having varying levels of permissions for different operations.
* *Easy Deployment with Docker*. You can quickly get started with Management Center using Docker Compose. For example, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run both Hazelcast and Management Center containers, with Management Center automatically connecting to the Hazelcast cluster. 
* *REST API and Integration*. Management Center offers REST API endpoints to programmatically access the information presented in the UI, making it easier to integrate with other systems and automate monitoring and management tasks. 
Using Management Center, you can manage your Hazelcast deployment, and quickly respond to any issues that may arise.

==== Adding Details to the Support Ticket

* When you open a support ticket add a concise title and description of the problem.
* Add steps to reproduce as best as you can document them so that support can attempt
to reproduce the problem. This includes Detailed description of incident â€“ what happened and when.
* Add a reproducible test case, this is optional - Hazelcast engineering may ask for it if required.
* Add details of use case. This is crucial as it helps support narrow down the features and
functionality in play when the problem occurred.
* Attach any specific errors found.
* Attach the complete logs files, i.e., Hazelcast logs.

systems specific information and details.
* Please make sure that the logs capture data around the date and time of the incident.

Please consider the above for prompt help from the team and note that the more information
is provided upfront the better.
Lastly, be prompt in your communication with Hazelcast support - helps to ensure timely resolution of issues.
