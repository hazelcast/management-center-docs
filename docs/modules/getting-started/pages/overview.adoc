:description: Hazelcast Management Center provides a powerful and intuitive interface for managing and monitoring your Hazelcast Platform clusters.

{description}

Using Management Center, you can manage your Hazelcast deployment with a user-friendly interface to monitor performance, view statistics, and perform administrative tasks, allowing you to respond quickly to any issues that may arise, and helping you maximize the value of your Hazelcast deployment.

== Enterprise versus Community Edition
