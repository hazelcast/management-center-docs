= Management Center {full-version}
:page-aliases: ROOT:index.adoc
:description: Hazelcast Management Center provides a powerful and intuitive interface for managing and monitoring your Hazelcast Platform clusters.

{description}

Using Management Center, you can manage your Hazelcast deployment with a user-friendly interface to monitor performance, view statistics, and perform administrative tasks, allowing you to respond quickly to any issues that may arise, and helping you maximize the value of your Hazelcast deployment.

NOTE: For information about xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:ROOT:whats-new.adoc[What's new], see the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

== {enterprise-product-name} versus {open-source-product-name}

While the {open-source-product-name} offers basic functionality for small deployments (up to 3 cluster members), the {enterprise-product-name} unlocks the full potential of Management Center with advanced security, monitoring, and management features. Get a 30-day free trial with no obligation from our https://hazelcast.com/get-started/[Try Hazelcast] page.

NOTE: To access Enterprise features, an Enterprise license must be installed on Management Center. See xref:deploy-manage:license-management.adoc[].
