= Management Center {full-version}
:page-aliases: ROOT:index.adoc
:description: Management Center is a tool for managing and monitoring Hazelcast Platform clusters.

{description}

You can use Management Center to monitor performance, view metrics, and perform administrative tasks such as license management and client filtering. This enables you manage your deployment effectively and respond quickly to any issues that arise, which helps maximize the value of your Hazelcast deployment.

NOTE: For information about what is new and improved across Hazelcast products and tools, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:ROOT:whats-new.adoc[What's new]. For detailed information about Management Center changes, see the xref:release-notes:releases.adoc[Release notes]. 

== {enterprise-product-name} versus {open-source-product-name}

If you have Hazelcast Platform {enterprise-product-name} then you have access to all Management Centre features, including advanced security, monitoring, and management features. You can either reuse your Hazelcast Platform license key or use a dedicated Enterprise license for Management Center. Otherwise, {open-source-product-name} offers basic functionality for small deployments (up to 3 cluster members).

The following table explains which features are available in Management Center based on your license:

* All other issues, e.g., questions or documentation review are considered as severity 3 or higher.

==== Adding Details to the Support Ticket

* When you open a support ticket add a concise title and description of the problem.
* Add steps to reproduce as best as you can document them so that support can attempt
to reproduce the problem. This includes Detailed description of incident â€“ what happened and when.
* Add a reproducible test case, this is optional - Hazelcast engineering may ask for it if required.
* Add details of use case. This is crucial as it helps support narrow down the features and
functionality in play when the problem occurred.
