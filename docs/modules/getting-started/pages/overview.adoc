:description: Management Center is a powerful tool for managing and monitoring Hazelcast Platform clusters.

{description}

Management Center provides a user-friendly interface to monitor performance, view statistics, and perform administrative tasks.

== Key Features and Benefits

* *Monitoring and Performance Tracking*. Management Center allows you to monitor the performance of your clusters through its UI, JMX interface, and Prometheus integration. You can view detailed statistics about members, clients, and data structures in real-time, helping you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your applications.
* *Execute SQL queries on your clusters*. The SQL Browser feature enables you to execute SQL queries on your clusters. Management Center shows queryable objects with a schema and index explorer, and can handle streaming SQL queries, displaying the last 1,000 entries as they arrive.
* *Administrative Capabilities*. Management Center enables you to perform various administrative tasks such as:
** Identifying and diagnosing issues in clusters
** Implementing client filtering to control which clients can connect to a cluster
** Executing scripts to automate interactions with the cluster
** Taking thread dumps from nodes
** Updating map configurations 
* *High Availability*. Management Center supports high availability deployments where multiple Management Center instances can connect to the same cluster, eliminating a single point of failure for management and monitoring purposes. 
User Management with Role-Based Access Control. Management Center provides comprehensive role-based access control with different user roles (Admin, User, Read-Only, and Metrics-Only) having varying levels of permissions for different operations.
* *Easy Deployment with Docker*. You can quickly get started with Management Center using Docker Compose. For example, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run both Hazelcast and Management Center containers, with Management Center automatically connecting to the Hazelcast cluster. 
* *REST API and Integration*. Management Center offers REST API endpoints to programmatically access the information presented in the UI, making it easier to integrate with other systems and automate monitoring and management tasks. 
Using Management Center, you can manage your Hazelcast deployment, and quickly respond to any issues that may arise.

[[os-requirements]]
== Requirements

You must meet the following requirements to be able to run Management Center.

=== Supported Java Virtual Machines

Hazelcast supports the latest and long-term support (LTS) versions of the Java Development Kit (JDK). However, the JVM in some JDKs may not be compatible with Hazelcast.

Management Center {full-version} has been tested against the following JDKs.

TIP: If you install Hazelcast with Docker or a package manager, it comes with a supported JDK.

include::{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:deploy:versioning-compatibility.adoc[tag=supported-jvms]

=== Mac and Windows System Requirements

Management Center uses the RocksDB library to persist metrics
to disk. Because of this dependency, Mac and Windows users must do one of the following:

* Use the official Management Center docker image.
* xref:deploy-manage:historical-metrics.adoc#disabling-metrics-persistence[Disable metrics persistence].
* Meet the following requirements:
** Mac: Use at least version 10.15 version of Catalina.
** Windows: Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 redistributable.

=== Linux System Requirements

Most Linux distributions are supported, assuming that `glibc` 2.12 or newer is installed.

Experimental support for AIX with Metrics Persistence disabled is provided.

=== Hazelcast Cluster Compatibility

Management Center supports the following versions of Hazelcast:
