= Management Center {full-version}
:page-aliases: ROOT:index.adoc
:description: Hazelcast Management Center provides a powerful and intuitive interface for managing and monitoring your Hazelcast Platform clusters.

{description}

You can use Management Center to monitor performance, view metrics, and perform administrative tasks such as license management and client filtering. This enables you manage your deployment effectively and respond quickly to any issues that arise, which helps maximize the value of your Hazelcast deployment.

NOTE: For information about what is new and improved across Hazelcast products and tools, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:ROOT:whats-new.adoc[What's new]. For detailed information about Management Center changes, see the xref:release-notes:releases.adoc[Release notes]. 

== {enterprise-product-name} versus {open-source-product-name}

If you have Hazelcast Platform {enterprise-product-name} then you have access to all Management Centre features, including advanced security, monitoring, and management features. You can either reuse your Hazelcast Platform license key or use a dedicated Enterprise license for Management Center. Otherwise, {open-source-product-name} offers basic functionality for small deployments (up to 3 cluster members).
