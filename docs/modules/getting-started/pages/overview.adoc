= Management Center {full-version}
:page-aliases: ROOT:index.adoc
:description: Management Center is a tool for managing and monitoring Hazelcast clusters.

{description}

Here are some example of what you can do with Management Center:

* Monitor the performance of your clusters.
* See statistical information about your members, clients, and data structures.
* Execute SQL queries on your clusters.
* Perform administrative tasks such as identifying and diagnosing issues in clusters.

You can also enable the REST API to use REST calls to return the
information presented in Management Center. You can also
monitor cluster statistics from a JMX interface and Prometheus.

== Requirements

You need Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or later to run Hazelcast Management Center.

Management Center uses RocksDB library to store metrics
data on disk. Because of that dependency, macOS users have to be on at least 10.15
version (Catalina) and Windows users need to have Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable
installed. Otherwise, you can use the official Management Center docker image.

=== Hazelcast Compatibility

Management Center supports Hazelcast 5.0.x and Hazelcast IMDG 4.2.x clusters.

=== System Requirements

Most Linux distributions are supported, assuming that `glibc` 2.12 or newer is installed.

Experimental support for AIX is provided as well, with the following prerequisites:

* `glibc` version is 2.17 or newer
* JRE 1.8 or newer is installed

== Licensing

If you don't have a license, you can use Management Center to monitor clusters of up to a maximum of three members.

If a page in the documentation requires an Enterprise license, it is labelled [.enterprise]*Enterprise*.

A valid Management Center license is required for:

* Clustered JMX
* Clustered REST (API)
* Cluster Client Filtering
* Prometheus Exporter
* Configuration healthcheck

And some Management Center features rely on your Hazelcast Platform's Enterprise capabilities:

* WAN Replication
* Persistence (Hot Restart)
* Rolling Upgrade

You need to have a valid license for your Hazelcast Platform to be able to manage and monitor the above.
