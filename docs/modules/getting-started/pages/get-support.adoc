When submitting a ticket to the team, please provide as much information and data as possible. 

=== Create a support ticket

TIP: Make sure that all your environments are capturing Hazelcast diagnostics logs.
This is key to diagnosing issues with Hazelcast environments.
If your environments are not capturing diagnostics logs, update them to capture these.
See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#enabling-diagnostics-logging[Enabling diagnostics logging] in the Platform documentation.

Provide the following details in the support ticket:

* Add a concise title that describes the problem. 
This allows the team to route the issue to the appropriate expert.
* Where possible, make a note of the steps that caused the issue, so that Support can attempt
to reproduce the problem. This should include a detailed description of the incident, with what happened and when.
Otherwise, capture the sequence of events that led to the issue.
* Add details of the use case. This is crucial as it helps Support narrow down the features and
functionality in play when the problem occurred.
* Attach any specific errors found.
* Capture any relevant screen shots.
* Specify the exact time of the incident.
* Attach the complete log files, i.e., Hazelcast logs. When providing Hazelcast logs, make sure that the system and
environment details captured at system startup are included, even if you truncate the logs.
Make sure the logs capture data around the date and time of the incident.
** Attach Hazelcast process logs.
** Attach Hazelcast health monitor logs.
** Attach thread dumps from all members.
** Attach Networking logs.
** Attach Hazelcast diagnostic logs. Do not truncate diagnostics logs. These only capture Hazelcast
systems specific information and details.
* Attach the appropriate severity to the ticket.
** `PROD` issues that affect production are considered as severity 1. 
All other issues in other environments are considered severity 2 or 3, depending on urgency.
** `DEV` issues are considered as severity 3 and priority low.
** All other issues, e.g., questions or documentation feedback review are considered as severity 3 or higher.
