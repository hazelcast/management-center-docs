= Maps
[[managing-maps]]

You can see a list of all the maps in your cluster
by clicking on the **Maps** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapGridView.png[Map Grid View]

You can filter the maps shown and you can also sort
the table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking
on a map name opens a new page for monitoring that map
instance on the right, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MonitoringMaps.png[Monitoring Maps]

The below subsections explain the portions of this window.

[[clear-map]]
== Removing Entries from a Map

You can use the *Clear Data* button to remove all entries from the map.

image:ROOT:ClearMapData.png[Clear Map Data View]

In the confirmation modal, enter the map name and confirm that you want to remove all entries from the map.

image:ROOT:ClearMapDataConfirmation.png[Clear Map Data Confirmation]

[[map-browser]]
== Exploring Map Entries

You can use the Map Browser tool to retrieve properties of the
entries stored in a selected map. To open the Map Browser
tool, click on the **Map Browser** button, located at the
top right of the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a
dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapBrowser.png[Map Browser]

Once the key and the key's type are specified and the **Browse**
button is clicked, the key's properties along with its value are
listed.

.Map Browser fields
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Value
|Value that is associated with the key in the map.

|Memory Cost
|Space, in bytes, the key and value cost to be hold in memory.

|Expiration Time
|Time the key was expired and deleted from the map (depends on expiration policy configuration).

|Last Access Time
|Last time the clients read the key's value.

|Last Stored Time
|Last time the key was stored into the storage.

|Time to Live
|Last set time to live (in milliseconds).

|Key Owner Member
|Address of the member that is owner of the key.

|Class
|Key's Java class.

|Creation Time
|First time the key was put.

|Hits
|Count of reads by the clients for the key's value in a map.

|Last Update Time
|Last time the key's value was updated.

|Version
|Count of times when the key's value has been overwritten.

|Max Idle
|Last set max idle time (in milliseconds).

|===

NOTE: To get all these fields, the map must have its `per-entry-stats-enabled` element set to `true`. See the xref:hazelcast:data-structures:reading-map-metrics.adoc#getting-statistics-about-a-specific-map-entry[Reading Map Metrics] section.

If you are using a serialization mechanism other than standard Java
serialization for storing values in your map, you need to
configure the client that Management Center uses for connecting to the
cluster (as described xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:serialization:serialization.adoc[here]). Note that if you
have any custom classes, you need to add the JAR containing them
to Management Center's classpath before starting it as described in xref:deploy-manage:configuring.adoc#providing-an-extra-classpath[Providing an Extra Classpath]. In case the value stored in the map is not a `String`
or of another Java primitive type, it is rendered as a JSON value as shown below:

image:ROOT:MapBrowserWithCustomTypedValue.png[Map Browser with Custom Typed Value]

[[map-config]]

NOTE: Management Center allows you to access contents of Hazelcast data structures (for instance map entries) via SQL Browser or Map Browser. It may be useful to restrict data access for Management Center if sensitive financial or personal information is stored in the cluster. Management Center cannot access the data if at least one member has the data access disabled. You can disable data access for Management Center in the member configuration file. See the xref:hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-data-access[Managing Data Access] section.

== Configuring a Map

You can use the Map Config tool to set the selected map's attributes, such
as the max size, TTL, and eviction policy. To open the Map Config
tool, click on the **Map Config** button, located at the top right of
the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapConfig.png[Map Config Tool]

You can change any attribute and click the **Save Configuration** button to save
your changes.

NOTE: The Map configuration is updated only on the members that Management Center is aware of at the time of the update. When a new member joins the cluster, the updated map configuration is not propagated to it.
If a member has persistence enabled, the updated map configuration is not persisted to disk and the updates are lost on the next restart.

[[map-monitoring]]
== Monitoring a Map

Besides the Map Browser and Map Config tools, the map monitoring
page shows two graphs that show various metrics of the map.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[graph section] for more information.

Under these charts are **Map Statistics**, **Map Throughput**,
 **Member Near Cache**, and **Client Near Cache** data tables.

[[map-statistics]]**Map Statistic Table** provides statistics distributed
over the members, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapStatisticDataTable.png[Map Statistic Data Table]

|Hits
|Number of hits (reads) of the entries that are owned by
the member, including those which are no longer in the map (for

|Dirty Entries
|Number of entries that the member owns and are
dirty (updated but not persisted yet). In the cases where *MapStore*
is enabled, these are the entries that are put to/removed from the
map but not written to/removed from a database yet.
