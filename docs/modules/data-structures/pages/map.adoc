= Maps
[[managing-maps]]

You can see a list of all the maps in your cluster
by clicking on the **Maps** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapGridView.png[Map Grid View]

You can filter the maps shown and you can also sort
the table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking
on a map name opens a new page for monitoring that map
instance on the right, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MonitoringMaps.png[Monitoring Maps]

The below subsections explain the portions of this window.

[[map-browser]]
== Map Browser

Use the Map Browser tool to retrieve properties of the
entries stored in the selected map. To open the Map Browser
tool, click on the **Map Browser** button, located at the
top right of the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a
dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapBrowser.png[Map Browser]

Once the key and the key's type are specified and the **Browse**
button is clicked, the key's properties along with its value are
listed.

.Map Browser fields
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Value
|Value that is associated with the key in the map.

|Class
|Key's Java class.

|Memory Cost
|Space, in bytes, the key and value cost to be hold in memory.

|Creation Time
|First time the key was put.

|Expiration Time
|Time the key was expired and deleted from the map (depends on expiration policy configuration).

|Hits
|Count of reads by the clients for the key's value in a map.

|Last Access Time
|Last time the clients read the key's value.

|Last Stored Time
|Last time the key was stored into the storage.

|Version
|Count of times where the key's value has been overwritten.

|Time to Live
|Last set time to live (in milliseconds).

|Max Idle
|Last set max idle time (in milliseconds).

|===

If you are using a serialization mechanism other than standard Java
serialization for storing values in your map, you need to
configure the client that Management Center uses for connecting to the
cluster (as described xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:serialization:serialization.adoc[here]). Note that if you
have any custom classes, you need to add the JAR containing them
to Management Center's classpath before starting it as described in xref:deploy-manage:configuring.adoc#providing-an-extra-classpath[Providing an Extra Classpath]. In case the value stored in the map is not a `String`
or of another Java primitive type, it is rendered as a JSON value as shown below:

[[map-config]]
== Map Config

Use the Map Config tool to set the selected map's attributes, such
as the backup count, TTL, and eviction policy. To open the Map Config
tool, click on the **Map Config** button, located at the top right of
the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapConfig.png[Map Config Tool]

You can change any attribute and click the **Update** button to save
your changes.

[[map-monitoring]]
== Map Monitoring

Besides the Map Browser and Map Config tools, the map monitoring
page shows two graphs that show various metrics of the map.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[graph section] for more information.

Under these charts are **Map Statistics**, **Map Throughput**,
 **Member Near Cache**, and **Client Near Cache** data tables.

[[map-statistics]]**Map Statistic Table** provides statistics distributed
over the members, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapStatisticDataTable.png[Map Statistic Data Table]

From left to right, this table lists the following:

.Map Statistics fields
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Members
|IP address and port of the member.

|Entries
|Number of entries owned by the member.

|Gets
|Number of get operations received by the member.

|Puts
|Number of put operations received by the member.

|Removes
|Number of remove operations received by the member.

|Entry Memory
|Memory cost of owned entries in the member.

|Backups
|Number of backup entries held by the member.

|Backup Memory
|Memory cost of backup entries held by the member.

|Events
|Number of events received by the member.

|Hits
|Number of hits (reads) of the entries that are owned by
the member, including those which are no longer in the map (for
example, may have been evicted). The number of hits may be inaccurate
after a partition is migrated to a new owner member.

|Locks
|Number of currently locked entries owned by the member.

|Dirty Entries
|Number of entries that the member owns and are
dirty (updated but not persisted yet). In the cases where *MapStore*
is enabled, these are the entries that are put to/removed from the
map but not written to/removed from a database yet.

|===

You can ascend or descend the order of the listings by clicking on
the column headings.

[[map-throughput]]**Map Throughput Table** provides information about the operations
(get, put, remove) performed on each member in the map, as shown below.

Caches, if available, on each member, as shown below.

[[map-client-near-cache-summary-data]]
**Client Near Cache Summary** provides summary information related to the Near Cache statistics aggregated for all the clients that have Near Cache enabled for this map.
Aggregated statistics are shown for the following periods:
_1 minute_, _5 minutes_, _30 minutes_ and _60 minutes_.
Currently, the table shows overall Near Cache effectiveness, calculated as hits/total reads ratio.

NOTE: You need to enable the statistics for clients to see them here.
See the xref:clusters:clients.adoc[Monitoring Clients section] for details.
