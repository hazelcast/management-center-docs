You can filter the Executors shown and you can also sort the table
by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
an Executor name opens a new page for monitoring that Executor
instance on the right, as shown below.

On top of the page, there are two graphs that show various metrics of the Executor.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[graph section] for more information.

Under these charts is the [[executor-operation-statistics]]**Executor Operation Statistics**
table. From left to right, this table lists the IP address and port of
members, the counts of pending, started and completed executors
per second, and the execution time and average start latency of
executors on each member. Click on the column heading to ascend
or descend the order of the listings.
