At the top of the page are two graphs that show various metrics for the Executor.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[graph section] for more information.

Under these charts is the [[executor-operation-statistics]]**Executor Operation Statistics**
table. From left to right, this table lists the IP address and port of
members, the counts of pending, started and completed executors
per second, and the execution time and average start latency of
executors on each member. 

To display listings in ascending or descending order, click on the
column headings.
