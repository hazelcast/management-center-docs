[[monitoring-executors]]

You can see a list of all the Executors in your cluster by clicking
on the **Executors** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

You can filter the Executors shown and you can also sort the table
by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
an Executor name opens a new page for monitoring that Executor
instance on the right, as shown below.

On top of the page, there are two graphs that show various metrics of the Executor.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[the graph section] for more information.

When you click on a desired monitoring, the chart loads with the
selected option. To open a chart as a separate dialog, click on the
image:ROOT:MaximizeChart.png[maximize] button placed at top right of each
chart. The below monitoring charts are available:

* **Pending**: Monitors the pending executors. Y-axis is the executor count.
* **Started**: Monitors the started executors. Y-axis is the executor count.
* **Start Lat. (msec.)**: Shows the latency when executors are started.
Y-axis is the duration in milliseconds.
* **Completed**: Monitors the completed executors. Y-axis is the executor count.
* **Comp. Time (msec.)**: Shows the completion period of executors.
Y-axis is the duration in milliseconds.

Under these charts is the [[executor-operation-statistics]]**Executor Operation Statistics**
table, as shown below.

From left to right, this table lists the IP address and port of
members, the counts of pending, started and completed executors
per second, and the execution time and average start latency of
executors on each member. Click on the column heading to ascend
or descend the order of the listings.
