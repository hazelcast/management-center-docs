At the top of the page are two graphs that show various metrics
for the reliable topic. See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[the graph section] for more information.

Under these charts is the **Reliable Topic Throughput Statistics** table.
From left to right, this table lists the IP addresses and ports of
each member, and counts of the messages published and received per
second in real-time.

To display listings in ascending or descending order, click on the
column headings.
