On top of the page, there are two graphs that show various metrics
of the reliable topic. See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[the graph section] for more information.

Under these charts is the Reliable Topic Operation Statistics table.
From left to right, this table lists the IP addresses and ports of
each member, and counts of the messages published and received per
second in real-time. You can select the period in the combo box placed
at top right corner of the table to show the table data. The available
values are **Since Beginning**, **Last Minute**, **Last 10 Minutes**
and **Last 1 Hour**.

Click on the column heading to ascend or descend the order of the listings.
