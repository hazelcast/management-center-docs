At the top of the page are two graphs that show various metrics for the queue.

Under these charts are **Queue Statistics** and **Queue Throughput Statistics** tables.

The [[queue-statistics]]Queue Statistics table provides item
and backup item counts in the queue, and age statistics of items
and backup items at each member, as shown below.
