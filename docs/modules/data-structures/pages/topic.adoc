At the top of the page are two graphs that show various metrics for the topic.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[the graph section] for more information.

Under these charts is the [[topic-throughput-statistics]]**Topic Throughput Statistics** table. From
left to right, this table lists the IP addresses and ports of each
member, and counts of the messages published and received per second
in real-time.

To display listings in ascending or descending order, click on the
column headings.
