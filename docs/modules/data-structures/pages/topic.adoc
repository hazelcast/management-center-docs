On top of the page, there are two widgets that show various metrics of the topic.
See the xref:widget.adoc[the Widget section] for more information.

Under these charts is the [[topic-operation-statistics]]Topic Operation Statistics table. From
left to right, this table lists the IP addresses and ports of each
member, and counts of the messages published and received per second
in real-time. You can select the period in the combo box placed at
top right corner of the table to show the table data. The available
values are **Since Beginning**, **Last Minute**, **Last 10 Minutes**
and **Last 1 Hour**.

Click on the column heading to ascend or descend the order of
the listings.
