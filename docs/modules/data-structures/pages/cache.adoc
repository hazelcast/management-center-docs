[[monitoring-caches]]

You can see a list of all the caches in your cluster by
clicking on the **Caches** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

You can filter the caches shown and you can also sort the table
by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
the cache name opens a new page for monitoring that cache
instance on the right, as shown below.

On top of the page, there are two widgets that show various metrics of the cache.
See the xref:widget.adoc[Widget section] for more information.

Under these charts are **Cache Statistics**, **Cache Throughput**, and **Client Near Cache**
data tables.

[[cache-statistics]]**Cache Statistics Table**
provides the selected cache's statistics distributed
over the members, as shown below.

image:ROOT:CacheStatistics.png[Cache Statistics Data Table]

From left to right, this table lists the following in real time:

.Cache Statistics fields
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Members
|IP address and port of the member.

|Entries
|Number of entries in this cache owned by the member.

|Gets/Puts/Removals
|Number of the get/put/remove operations for this cache received by the member.

|Evictions
|Number of evictions of Cache entries owned by the member.

|Hits
|Number of the reads performed for this cache's entries.

|Misses
|Number of the entries which cannot be found in the cache when requested to read.

|Avg Get/Put/Removal Time
|Average elapsed time for the get/put/removal operations for the
cache on each member.

To ascend or descend the order of the listings, click on the
column headings.

[[cache-throughput]]**Cache Throughput Statistic Table** provides information about the
operations (get, put, remove) performed on each member for the selected
cache.

image:ROOT:CacheThroughput.png[Cache Throughput Data Table]

From left to right, this table lists the following:

* IP address and port of each member.
* Put, get and remove operation rates on each member for this cache.

You can select the period in the combo box placed at the top right
corner of the window, for which the table data will be shown. Available
values are **Since Beginning**, **Last Minute**, **Last 10 Minutes**
and **Last 1 Hour**.

You can ascend or descend the order of the listings in each column
by clicking on column headings.

[[cache-client-near-cache-summary-data]]
**Client Near Cache Summary** provides summary information related to the Near Cache statistics aggregated for all the clients that have Near Cache enabled for this cache.
Aggregated statistics are shown for the following periods:
_1 minute_, _5 minutes_, _30 minutes_ and _60 minutes_.
Currently, the table shows overall Near Cache effectiveness, calculated as hits/total reads ratio.

NOTE: You need to enable the statistics for clients to see them here.
See the xref:clusters:clients.adoc[Monitoring Clients section] for details.

image:ROOT:ClientNearCacheSummaryTable.png[Maps Client Near Cache Summary]

[[cache-client-near-cache-data]]
**Client Near Cache Table** provides information about the Near Caches statistics, if available, on each client that has Near Cache enabled for this cache, as shown below.

NOTE: You need to enable the statistics for clients to see them here.
See the xref:monitor-clients.adoc[Monitoring Clients section] for details.

NOTE: You need to enable the statistics for caches to monitor them
in the Management Center. Use the `<statistics-enabled>` element or
`setStatisticsEnabled()` method in declarative or programmatic
configuration, respectively, to enable the statistics. Please refer
to the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:jcache:setup.adoc#jcache-declarative-configuration[JCache Declarative Configuration]
section for more information.
