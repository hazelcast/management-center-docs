The *Storage*, *Compute*, and *Messaging* menus in Management Center allow you to monitor different types of data structures and services in your Hazelcast cluster.

== Storage

Use the *Storage* menu to monitor data storage structures, including: 

* xref:data-structures:map.adoc[Maps]. Here, you can also set the selected map's attributes.
* xref:data-structures:replicated-map.adoc[Replicated Maps]
* xref:data-structures:cache.adoc[Caches]
* xref:data-structures:multimap.adoc[MultiMaps]
* xref:data-structures:list.adoc[Lists]
* xref:data-structures:set.adoc[Sets]
* xref:data-structures:pn-counter.adoc[PN Counters]
* xref:data-structures:flake-id-gen.adoc[Flake ID Generators]

This helps you track memory usage, entry counts, and performance metrics for your stored data. 

== Compute

Use the *Compute* menu to monitor Executors for tracking distributed computation tasks running on your cluster:

* xref:data-structures:executor.adoc[Executors]

== Messaging

Use the *Messaging* menu to monitor messaging structures:

* xref:data-structures:queue.adoc[Queues]
* xref:data-structures:topic.adoc[Topics]
* xref:data-structures:reliable-topic.adoc[Reliable Topics]

These menus provide a comprehensive view of your cluster's data structures, allowing you to monitor performance, usage patterns, and the overall health of your Hazelcast deployment.
