MultiMap is a specialized map where you can associate a key
with multiple values. 

You can see a list of all the MultiMaps in your cluster by clicking
on the **MultiMaps** menu item on the left panel. A new
page appears on the right, as shown below.

You can filter the MultiMaps shown, and you can also sort the
table by clicking on the column headers. Click on
a MultiMap name to open a new page for monitoring that
MultiMap instance on the right.

[[multimap-statistics]]This monitoring option is similar to the
**Maps** option in that the same monitoring charts and data tables monitor
MultiMaps. The difference is that you cannot browse MultiMaps
and re-configure them. See the <<managing-maps, Managing Maps>>.
