You can filter the MultiMaps shown and you can also sort the
table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
a MultiMap name opens a new page for monitoring that
MultiMap instance on the right.

MultiMap is a specialized map where you can associate a key
with multiple values. [[multimap-statistics]]This monitoring option is similar to the
**Maps** option: the same monitoring charts and data tables monitor
MultiMaps. The differences are that you cannot browse the MultiMaps
and re-configure it. Please see the <<managing-maps, Managing Maps>>.
