[[managing-vector-collections]]

You can see a list of all the vector collections in your cluster
by clicking on the **Vector Collections** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

|Field|Description

|Name
|Name of vector collection.

|Creation Time
|First time the key was put.

|Last Access Time
|Last time the clients read the key's value.

|Last Update Time
|Last time the key's value was updated.

You can filter and sort the displayed vector collections by clicking on the column headers. Click
on a vector collection name to open a new page for monitoring that vector collection
instance on the right, as shown below.

== Monitoring a Vector Collection

The vector collection monitoring
page shows two graphs that show various metrics of the vector collection.
See the xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[graph section] for more information.

Under these charts are **Vector Collection Statistics** and **Vector Collection Throughput** data tables.

[[vector-collection-statistics]]**Vector Collection Statistic Table** provides statistics distributed
over the members, as shown below.
