You can see a list of all Flake ID Generators in your
cluster by clicking on the **Flake ID Generators** menu item on
the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

You can filter the generators shown and you can also sort
the table by clicking on the column headers.
The monitoring data available are:

* **Avg. Batch Requests:** Average count of batch requests
coming from all the members to a generator, i.e., total batch
requests from all members to a generator divided by the member
count for that generator.
* **Avg. Batch Size:** Average size of the ID batches created
by a generator, i.e., total number of IDs generated (the sum
of IDs for all batches) for all members divided by the total
count of batch requests coming from all members.

[[id-generator-details]]Clicking on a generator name opens a new page for
monitoring that specific generator instance, as shown below.

The table can likewise be sorted by clicking the column
headers.
It shows IP and port of the members that have a state for
the specific generator named in the page's title.
The monitoring data available are:

* **Batch Requests:** Total count of batch requests to a
generator by this member.
* **Avg. Batch Size:** Average size of the ID batches
created for this member, i.e., total number of IDs generated
(the sum of IDs for all batches) for this member divided by
the total count of batch requests coming from this member.

NOTE: The operations per second is not the number of new IDs
generated or used but the number of ID batches.
The batch size is configurable, usually it contains hundreds
or thousands of IDs.
A client uses all IDs from a batch before a new batch is requested.
