You can use the scripting feature of the Management Center to execute scripts
on the cluster.

== Before you begin

Scripting is disabled by default, and you need to enable it
in your cluster's configuration. See the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-scripting-support[Toggle Scripting Support] for details. The member list shows whether
scripting is enabled or disabled for each member.

NOTE: Java 15 and newer versions do not come with a JavaScript engine. If you want to use JavaScript as a scripting language on a member with Java 15 and newer, the appropriate libraries should be placed in the classpath of that member. See the <<scripting-languages, Enabling Scripting Languages section>> for more details.

== Scripting in JavaScript

To use this feature, click on the **Scripting** menu item
on the left panel.

image:ROOT:Scripting.png[Scripting]

In this window, the left panel is the actual script code editor.
The combo box located at the top part of the editor enables
you to select a scripting language: currently, JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy and Python
languages are supported. You can select the members on which the code will execute
from the **Members** list shown on the right side of the screen.
After you write your script and press the **Execute** button, you can see
the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.

NOTE: To use the scripting languages other than JavaScript on a member,
the libraries for those languages should be placed in the classpath of that member.
See the <<scripting-languages, Enabling Scripting Languages section>>
for more details.

There are **Save** and **Delete** buttons on the top right of the scripting editor.
To save your scripts, press the **Save** button after you type a name for your script
into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts**
part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. Click on a saved script from
this list to execute or edit it. If you want to remove a script that you wrote and saved
before, select it from this list and press the **Delete** button.

In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable
named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via
the `hazelcast` variable. An example usage for JavaScript is below:

[source,javascript]
----
var name = hazelcast.getName();
var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();
var employees = hazelcast.getMap("employees");
employees.put("1","John Doe");
employees.get("1"); // will return "John Doe"
----

== Enable scripting languages

Hazelcast members use the `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` API for the execution of the script.
The JavaScript engine is available in most JVMs of versions older than 15 by default.
To use a scripting language on a member, you need to add the
corresponding scripting engine and all its transitive dependencies to the classpath of that member.

Here is an example of
Maven configuration for several scripting engines:
