WARNING: The console is not recommended for production use.

Console is disabled by default, and you need to enable it
in your cluster's configuration. See the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-console-support[Toggle Console Support] for details. The member list shows whether
console is enabled or disabled for each member.

. Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located at the top menu.

TIP: You can also open the console, using the kbd:[Alt + T] keyboard shortcut on Windows/Linux and kbd:[Option + T] on
Mac.

NOTE: The console does not support data structures with spaces or special characters in their names.
