{description}

Management Center includes an interactive version of Hazelcast's Command-Line Client (CLC).
CLC functions as a client and adheres to any Security ACLs configured for it.

CLC supports a wide range of data structures and the ability to run SQL queries from a text terminal.
It also provides flexible output options, such as table, CSV, and JSON formats.

For further information on these features, refer to the https://docs.hazelcast.com/clc/latest/overview[Overview^] topic of the CLC documentation.

WARNING: The console is not recommended for production use.

TIP: Embedded CLC only supports the PKCS12 store type for TLS. If you're using any other TLS configuration, you'll need to convert it to PKCS12 to use it with CLC.

Console is disabled by default, and you need to enable it
in your cluster's configuration. See
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-console-support[Toggle Console Support] for details. The member list shows whether
the console is enabled or disabled for each member.

. Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located at the Side Bar.

To get help or a list of all possible commands, enter `\help` in the console.
You can use the `--help` option with any command to view the help for that command.

TIP: The console container is resizable; to change the height, drag the bar on the top of the console.
You can maximize or minimize the console container using the icons in its top-right corner.

WARNING: CLC binary is not signed for Windows users.
You may need to grant access to it or sign it manually in order to use it.
You can find the binary inside the clc folder in the Management Center home directory.
