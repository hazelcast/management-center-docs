{description}

Management Center includes an interactive version of Hazelcast's Command-Line Client (CLC).
CLC functions as a client and adheres to any Security ACLs configured for it.

CLC offers support for a wide range of data structures and the ability to run SQL queries from a text terminal. 
It also provides flexible output options, such as table, CSV, and JSON formats.

For more information on these features, visit: https://docs.hazelcast.com/clc/latest/overview
