{description}

Management Center includes an interactive version of Hazelcast's Command-Line Client (CLC).
CLC functions as a client and adheres to any Security ACLs configured for it.

CLC supports a wide range of data structures and the ability to run SQL queries from a text terminal. 
It also provides flexible output options, such as table, CSV, and JSON formats.

For further information on these features, refer to the https://docs.hazelcast.com/clc/latest/overview[Overview^] topic of the CLC documentation.

WARNING: The console is not recommended for production use.

Console is disabled by default, and you need to enable it
in your cluster's configuration. See 
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-console-support[Toggle Console Support] for details. The member list shows whether
the console is enabled or disabled for each member.

. Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located at the Side Bar.

To get help or a list of all possible commands, enter `\help` in the console.
You can use the `--help` option with any command to view the help for that command.

TIP: The console container is resizable; to change the height, drag the bar on the top of the console.
You can maximize or minimize the console container using the icons in its top-right corner.
