This section details how a Hazelcast cluster can be queried with SQL using Management Center. (Please see the xref:hazelcast:sql:sql-statements.adoc[SQL Statements section] of the Hazelcast documentation for details about SQL queries.)

You can use the SQL browser for this purpose, which can be opened using
**SQL Browser** in the top menu, after you connect Management Center to a cluster.

Once you click **SQL Browser**, the browser opens as shown below:

To query an existing map in the cluster, select the map's name from the dropdown:

* If the map does not have a mapping, an autogenerated `CREATE MAPPING` statement will be inserted into the editor. This statement is to map a data structure
(a distributed map for example) to a table that Hazelcast can access.
* If the map already has a mapping, an autogenerated `SELECT` statement will be inserted into the editor.

To execute the autogenerated query, click
**Execute Query** button.

After a successful query execution, you will see the results under **Query Results** in two formats:

* As a plain list (**List**) where the `__key` and `this` columns represent the map entries' keys and values, respectively.
* As a **JSON View** where the same data is represented in JSON format. 

Here is an example list of query results:

You can use **Export as CVS** to export the query result as a CSV file in
a format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180].

Here is an example JSON view of the same query results:

You can use **Copy to Clipboard** in the top right corner to copy
the result into your clipboard.

On the **History** tab, you can see the history of query execution. It holds last
one hundred executed queries. Each row contains **Execution Time**,
**Execution Status** and **Query** values. You can re-execute any query from the
history by pushing a button in the **Execute** column.

You can also use **Clear Query Result** to remove the query results from both list and JSON views.

== Example Usage - Creating a Map

Here, you will create a map and put values into it using SQL browser, assuming you have a running Hazelcast cluster and
Management Center is connected to the cluster.

. Open the SQL browser and execute the following SQL statement to create a map called `my_first_map`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING my_first_map TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----
. Delete the above statement and now execute the following.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO my_distributed_map VALUES
('1', 'John'),
('2', 'Mary'),
('3', 'Jane');
----
. Close the SQL browser and go to **Storage** > **Maps** to verify that `my_first_map` is created with its entries.
