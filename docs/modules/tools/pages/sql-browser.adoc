= Executing SQL Queries
:page-aliases: ROOT:sql-browser.adoc
:description: You can use Management Center to execute SQL queries on a Hazelcast cluster.

{description}

== Before you Begin

If a map contains domain objects, the classes for those objects must be on the classpath of Management Center before you can query them. See the xref:deploy-manage:configuring.adoc#starting-with-an-extra-classpath[Providing an Extra Classpath].

== Using the SQL Browser

Click **SQL Browser** in the toolbar.

To query an existing map in the cluster, select the map's name from the dropdown:

* If the map does not have a mapping, an autogenerated `CREATE MAPPING` statement is inserted into the editor. This statement maps the data structure to a table that Hazelcast can access.
* If the map already has a mapping, an autogenerated `SELECT` statement is inserted into the editor.

To execute a query, click
**Execute Query**.

After a successful query execution, you will see the results under **Query Results** in two formats:

* As a plain list, where the `__key` and `this` columns represent the map entries' keys and values.
* As JSON, where the same data is represented in JSON format.

== Exporting Query Results as a CSV file

You can use **Export as CVS** to export the query result as a CSV file in
a format https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC 4180].

Here is an example JSON view of the same query results:

To copy
the result to the clipboard, use the **Copy to Clipboard** button in the top right corner.

== Viewing Executed SQL Queries

In the **History** tab, you can see the history of query execution. The history holds the last
one hundred executed queries. Each row contains **Execution Time**,
**Execution Status** and **Query** values. You can re-execute any query from the
history by pushing a button in the **Execute** column.

You can also use **Clear Query Result** to remove the query results from both the list and JSON views.

== Creating a Map

. Open the SQL browser and execute the following SQL statement to create a map called `my_first_map`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING my_first_map TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----
. Delete the above statement and now execute the following.
+
[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO my_first_map VALUES
('1', 'John'),
('2', 'Mary'),
('3', 'Jane');
----
. Close the SQL browser and go to **Storage** > **Maps** to verify that `my_first_map` is created.
