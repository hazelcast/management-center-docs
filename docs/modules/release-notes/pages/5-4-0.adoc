= 5.4.0 Release Notes
:description:
These release notes list any new features, enhancements, and fixes that were made between version 5.3.3 and 5.4.0 of Hazelcast Management Center (MC).
{description}

NOTE: Hazelcast Management Center 5.4 requires Java 17 or later to run.

NOTE: This only applies if you are upgrading your MC: MC 5.4.0 uses H2 2.x as its internal database instead of H2 1.x used by the previous MC releases. 
H2 1.x and 2.x are not compatible so a data migration step is required.
If you use the provided `hz-mc` or `mc-start` scripts to start MC, no further actions are needed as they handle the migration seamlessly. If you use
a custom run script, refer to the documentation for comprehensive instructions on migrating MC data. If the internal database is not upgraded, then MC will start with a new configuration.
