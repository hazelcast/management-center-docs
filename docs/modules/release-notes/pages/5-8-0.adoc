== New features

* *Console and CLC support in MC 5.8.0*:Some customers have reported issues using the Command Line Client (CLC) in Management Center.
+
As these customers are upgrading from an earlier version where the original Console was used, we have added an option in MC 5.8.0 to replace CLC with the original Console.  This is enabled by setting the environment variable `HAZELCAST_MC_ORIGINAL_CONSOLE_ENABLED` to `true`.
+
See xref:tools:console.adoc[] for further details.

+
Note: the V1 metrics continue to be exported with no changes to their format.
+
