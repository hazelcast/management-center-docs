== Breaking Changes

Console access is now disabled by default in the members' configuration. If you use the console in Management Center, console access needs to be enabled. See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-console-support[Managing Console Support] in the Platform documentation.

[[notes-511]]
== Notes

* Management Center 5.1 does not support Jet 4.5. It only supports IMDG 4.2, Hazelcast Platform 5.0 and later.
* Management Center 5.1 supports SQL Browsing on Hazelcast Platform 5.0 and later.  Platform 5.1 is highly recommended for SQL/Streaming support.
* You should avoid updating the Client Filtering configuration during rolling upgrades if multiple Management Center instances are connected to the same cluster to keep the configuration consistent.
