== Enhancements

* Security: Console access can be enabled or disabled in the members' config.  This defaults to disabled (breaking change).

* SQL Browser provides instructions if `hazelcast-sql` has not been included in the classpath. [MC-871]
* SQL Browser has improved messages when mappings cannot be automatically generated. [MC-1160]
* SQL Browser when creating a mapping, the mapping name now defaults to the map's name. [MC-1288]
* SQL Browser the returned results for each field is capped to 1024 characters to prevent large fields from slowing down MC. [MC-1203]

* Duration column has been added to the Completed Jobs table [MC-151]
* Near Cache stats now includes `invalidations` and `invalidationRequest` metrics. [MC-340]
* MC own connection(s) to the cluster are now excluded from the client count. [MC-1162]
* MC's operation timeout with the cluster can now be configured so that long-running operations (like script executions) do not timeout. [MC-1285]

[[fixes-511]]
== Fixes

* Helpful error if running on an architecture that is not supported by RocksDB. [MC-1208]

* Button added to Security Provide configs to clear current value in the field. [MC-201]
* Fixed a TTL setting in metrics storage. [MC-150]
* Fixed an incorrect avgEventLatency on WAN Replication screen. [MC-1151]
* WAN Sync menu dropdowns have been expanded to match the length of the Map names.  [MC-1139]
* Fixed the tooltips shown in the WAN Replication screens so they do not overlap. [MC-1153]
* Fix for displaying a large number of maps in the WAN Sync screen. [MC-1185]

== Breaking Changes

Console access is now disabled by default in the members' configuration. If you use the console in Management Center, console access needs to be enabled. See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#managing-console-support[Managing Console Support] in the Platform documentation.

[[notes-511]]
== Notes

* Management Center 5.1 does not support Jet 4.5. It only supports IMDG 4.2, Hazelcast Platform 5.0 and later.
* Management Center 5.1 supports SQL Browsing on Hazelcast Platform 5.0 and later.  Platform 5.1 is highly recommended for SQL/Streaming support.
* You should avoid updating the Client Filtering configuration during rolling upgrades if multiple Management Center instances are connected to the same cluster to keep the configuration consistent.
