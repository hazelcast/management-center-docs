= Troubleshoot Hazelcast clusters
:description: Management Center writes log entries for each connection failure and allows you to trigger garbage collection and take thread dumps.

{description} This topic describes how to work with these operations to help identify the issues in a Hazelcast cluster.

== Logs for cluster connection failures

Management Center logs all cluster connection failures, their reasons and retry attempts to `hz-client.log` in `hazelcast.mc.home` directory.

== Run garbage collection

Running a garbage collection means cleaning up a member's memory, for example, removing the unused
data structure objects. 
Hazelcast do not recommend you run it unless instructed to do so by the Hazelcast support team.

To run garbage collection for a specific member, go to **Cluster** > **Members** and select
the member in question. In the member details screen, you will see **Run GC**.

Click the button, and you will be prompted to confirm. Note that this operation
does not write information to a file, it only cleans up the member's memory in the background.

== Take a thread dump

Thread dumps may be useful to troubleshoot a member that is deadlocked or slow;
they provide detailed information on threads, including the state for each thread.
We recommend collecting and providing multiple thread dumps when submitting a support ticket.

To take a thread dump for a member, go to **Cluster** > **Members** and select
the member in question. In the member details screen, you will see **Thread Dump** next to **Run GC** 
as shown in the above screenshot. This operation shows the collected thread dump in a separate dialog box.
