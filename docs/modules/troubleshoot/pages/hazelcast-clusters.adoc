= Troubleshooting Hazelcast Clusters
:description: Management Center writes log entries for each connection failure and allows you to trigger garbage collection and take thread dumps.

{description} This section describes how to work with these operations to help identifying the issues in a Hazelcast cluster.

== Logs for Cluster Connection Failures

Management Center logs all cluster connection failures, their reasons and retry attempts to `hz-client.log` in `hazelcast.mc.home` directory.

== Running Garbage Collection

Running a garbage collection means cleaning up a member's memory, e.g., removing the unused
data structure objects. It is not recommended to run it unless instructed by the Hazelcast support team.

To run garbage collection for a specific member, go to **Cluster** > **Members** and select
the member in question. In the member details screen, you will see **Run GC**.

Once you click the button, you will be asked to confirm. Note that this operation
does not write information to a file, only cleans up the member's memory in the background.

== Taking a Thread Dump

Thread dumps may be useful to troubleshoot a member that is deadlocked or slow;
they provide detailed information on threads, including the state for each thread.
We recommend collecting and providing multiple thread dumps when submitting a support ticket.

To take a thread dump for a member, go to **Cluster** > **Members** and select
the member in question. In the member details screen, you will see **Thread Dump** next to **Run GC** 
as shown in the above screenshot. This operation shows the collected thread dump in a separate dialog.
