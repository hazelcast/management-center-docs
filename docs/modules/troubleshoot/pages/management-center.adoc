:page-aliases: ROOT:automated-security-scan.adoc, ROOT:troubleshooting.adoc, ROOT:ui-logs.adoc

This section describes how to deal with known issues and also how to read the user interface logs of Management Center.

== Automated Security Scanning

When you scan Management Center artifacts, your tool might warn you about the following
vulnerabilities. Management Center security is *not* affected by them. It uses a custom
version of H2DB which is patched against these vulnerabilities.

* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10054[CVE-2018-10054^]
* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14335[CVE-2018-14335^]

== Horizontal Scrollbar in Tables when Using macOS

macOS automatically shows a horizontal scrollbar in the status tables of Management Center, when you scroll through a table content.

The scrollbar should hide shortly after you stop scrolling. This is the default behavior and it shouldn't
cause any inconvenience. However, if you still want to change it, address "Show scroll bars" section of the
link:https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-general-preferences-mchlp1225/mac["Change General preferences on Mac" guide].

== User Interface Logs

Using the **UI Logs** page of **Settings**,
you can see the log entries related to the Management
Center user interface. This page looks like the following:

This is basically useful to make the troubleshooting easier
related to the issues in the user interface. You can see the
timestamp and type of each log entry.

You can reorder the entries by their timestamps any types, and
also filter them by entering a keyword in the *Data* field such as
"auth", "map" and "session".

You can pause the log flow using the **Pause** button,
copy the log entries to the clipboard using **Copy**
(so that the entries can be examined in detail)
and resume the flow using **Resume**.

NOTE: You may only need to share the information in these logs
if requested by the Hazelcast's support team.
