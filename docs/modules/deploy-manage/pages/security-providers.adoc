TIP: You can create and manage users both in the Management Center UI and with the `mc-conf` tool only if you use the local security provider.
- xref:active-directory.adoc[*Active Directory*]: Use an existing Active Directory server for user authentication and authorization.
- xref:jaas.adoc[*JAAS*]: Use your own `javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule` implementation
for user authentication and authorization.

- xref:saml.adoc[*SAML*]: Use SAML single sign-on with Management Center.
- xref:openid.adoc[*OpenID Connect*]: Use OpenID Connect single sign-on with Management Center.
