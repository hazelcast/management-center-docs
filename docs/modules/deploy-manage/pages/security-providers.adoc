{description}

Management Center comes with the following security providers:

- xref:dev-mode.adoc[*Dev mode*]: No login required. One admin user. No authentication token needed to use the REST API.
- xref:local-security-provider.adoc[*Local*]: Manage user logins and authentication in Management Center.
+
TIP: You can create and manage users both in the Management Center UI and with the `mc-conf` tool only if you use the local security provider.
- xref:active-directory.adoc[*Active Directory*]: Use an existing Active Directory server for user authentication and authorization.
- xref:jaas.adoc[*JAAS*]: Use your own `javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule` implementation
for user authentication and authorization.
- xref:ldap.adoc[*LDAP*]: Use an existing Active Directory server for user authentication and authorization.
- xref:saml.adoc[*SAML*]: Use SAML single sign-on with Management Center.
- xref:openid.adoc[*OpenID Connect*]: Use OpenID Connect single sign-on with Management Center.

You can select dev mode as a security provider only when you first launch Management Center. To configure all other security providers, go to *Settings* > *Security Providers*.
