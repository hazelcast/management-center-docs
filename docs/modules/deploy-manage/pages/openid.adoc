== Setting Up the OpenID Connect Security Provider

To set up OpenID Connect, you need to configure settings either in the UI or the `hz-mc conf` tool.

[tabs] 
====
UI::
+

Go to *Settings* > *Security Providers* > *OpenID Connect*.

mc-conf::
+
--
Use the `oidc configure` task. For help, use the `-h` flag or see xref:mc-conf.adoc[].

.Linux and Mac
```bash
hz-mc conf oidc configure
```

.Windows
```bash
mc-conf.bat oidc configure 
```

* **Client ID:** The OAuth2 client ID that you obtain from your OpenID provider.
* **Client Secret:** The OAuth2 client secret you obtain from your OpenID provider.
* **Authorization Endpoint:** Authorization endpoint URL of your OpenID provider.
* **User Info Endpoint:** User info endpoint URL of your OpenID provider.
* **Token Endpoint:** Token endpoint URL of your OpenID provider.
* **JWK Set Endpoint:** JWK set endpoint URL of your OpenID provider.
* **Issuer:** Issuer identifier of your OpenID provider. It is usually (but not always) a URL.
* **Redirect URL:** URL of the Management Center endpoint that handles responses to authentication
requests, including schema (`http://` or `https://`) and port. It is located under the path
`/oidc/auth`, so you should append `/oidc/auth` to the Management Center URL.
Your OpenID provider should have access to this URL as it will post back responses to authentication
requests to this URL. For example, if Management
Center and the OpenID provider are on the same machine, you would enter
“http://127.0.0.1:8080/oidc/auth”.
* **Groups Claim Name:** Name of the claim that contains group(s) of the user.
* **JWS Algorithm:** JWS algorithm to use.
* **UserInfo Request HTTP Method:** HTTP method to use for sending a UserInfo request. Either `GET` or `POST`.
Default value is  `GET`. Note that IBM MCM requires this to be `POST`.
* **Send Client Info in Token Request:** Whether Management Center should send client ID and client secret
as extra parameters in the token request. *No* by default. Note that IBM MCM requires these extra
parameters in its token endpoint, so it should be *Yes* when deployed there.
* **Admin Groups:** Members of this group have admin privileges on the Management Center. To use more
than one group, separate them with the group name separator you have configured.
* **User Groups:** Members of this group have read and write privileges on the Management Center.
To use more than one group, separate them with the group name separator you have configured.
* **Read-only User Groups:** Members of this group have only read privilege on the Management
Center. To use more than one group, separate them with the group name separator you have configured.
* **Metrics-only Groups:** Members of this group have the privilege to see only the metrics
on the Management Center. To use more than one group, separate them with the group name separator
you have configured.

NOTE: If the user has more than one authority, Management Center uses the highest one.

Once you configure OpenID Connect, a button for single sign-on will be shown in the login page. Clicking it will
start the OpenID Connect single sign-on process. If you don't have an existing session with your OpenID provider,
you will be taken to the login page of your OpenID provider. Once you log into your OpenID provider,
you will be redirected back to Management Center as a logged in user.

NOTE: Management Center uses the `sub` claim to determine the user's ID and the `preferred_username`
claim to determine which username to show in the user interface. Make sure your OpenID provider returns these two claims, when asked.

== Creating and Managing Users

To create and manage additional users, you must register them with your OpenID Connect provider.

When creating users, be sure to give them a valid role. See xref:user-management.adoc[].
