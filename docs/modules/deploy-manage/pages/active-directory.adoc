== Setting Up the Active Directory Security Provider

To set up Active Directory, you need to configure settings either in the UI or the `mc-conf` tool.

[tabs]
====
UI::
+
--
To set up the local security provider in the UI, go to *Settings* > *Security Providers* > *Active Directory*.

Before saving your configuration, you can test it by clicking the **Test**
button. The user you test with needs to be a member of one of
the groups you have configured for the Management Center.
--
mc-conf::
+
--
Use the `active-directory configure` task. For help, use the `-h` flag or see xref:mc-conf.adoc[].

.Linux and macOS
[source,bash]
----
mc-conf.sh active-directory configure
----

.Windows
[source,bash]
----
mc-conf.bat active-directory configure

====

* **URL:** URL of your Active Directory server, including the
schema (`ldap://` or `ldaps://`) and port.
* **Domain:** Domain of your organization on Active Directory.
* **User Search Filter:** LDAP search filter expression to search
for the users. `\{0\}` will be replaced with `username@domain` and
`\{1\}` will be replaced with only the `username`. You can use both
placeholders, only one of them or none in your search filter. For
example, `(&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName=\{0\}))` searches
for a username that matches with the `userPrincipalName` attribute
and member of the object class `user`.
+
NOTE: You can use the xref:system-properties.adoc#hazelcast-mc-ldap-timeout[`hazelcast.mc.ldap.timeout` property] to
specify both connect and read timeout values for Active Directory search
queries. It is in milliseconds and its default value is `3000` milliseconds.
* **Admin Groups:** Members of this group and its nested groups
have admin privileges on the Management Center. To use more
than one group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **User Groups:** Members of this group and its nested groups
have read and write privileges on the Management Center. To
use more than one group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **Read-only User Groups:** Members of this group and its nested
groups have only read privilege on the Management Center. To
use more than one group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **Metrics-only Groups:** Members of this group and its nested
groups have the privilege to see only the metrics on Management
Center. To use more than one group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **Nested Group Search:** Disable if you have a large LDAP group structure
and it takes a long time to query all nested groups during login.

== Creating and Managing Users

To create and manage additional users, you must configure them in Active Directory.

When creating users, be sure to give them a valid role. See xref:user-management.adoc[].

== Updating Active Directory Settings

Once configured, Active Directory settings are saved in a local database managed by Management Center.
If you need to update your settings afterwards, you need to provide the import properties file under `<hazelcast-mc>/import/securityHotReload.properties`, and then click on the **Reload Security Config** button on the login page.
The `securityHotReload.properties` should contain the following properties:

```
url=<active directory instance url>
domain=<domain>
adminGroup=<Admin group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
userGroup=<Read-write group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
readonlyUserGroup<Read-only group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
metricsOnlyGroup<Metrics-only group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
```

NOTE: The **Reload Security Config** button will only appear
when the `<hazelcast-mc>/import/securityHotReload.properties` file is present.
After a successful import, the file will be renamed as `importedSecurityHotReload-<import_timestamp>.properties.bak`.

Alternatively, you can use the `mc-conf` tool's `security reset` and `active-directory configure` tasks to
configure the Active Directory security provider from scratch,
but you need to stop the Management Center service for this configuration option.
See xref:deploy-manage:mc-conf.adoc[] for more information.

== Enabling TLS/SSL for Active Directory

If your Active Directory service is using TLS/SSL protocol,
use the following command line
parameters for your Management Center deployment:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.ldap.ad.trustStore`: Path to the truststore. This
truststore needs to contain the public key of your Active Directory server.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.ldap.ad.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.ldap.ad.trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.ldap.ad.trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm
based on which the authentication keys are provided. System default is used
if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.
