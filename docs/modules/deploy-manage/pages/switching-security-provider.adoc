= Switching to a New Security Provider

If you've set up dev mode, you can switch to a new security provider by disabling dev mode in the UI.

If you've set up any other security provider, you must use the `hz-mc conf` tool to reset the security provider before setting up a new one.

If you want to use the `hz-mc conf` tool to switch from dev mode to another security provider, you must reset the security provider first.

== Using the UI

To switch to a different security provider from dev mode in the UI, go to *Settings* > *Security Providers*.

== Using mc-conf

To switch to another security provider with the `hz-mc conf` tool, use the `security reset` task to reset the provider first.

This task deletes all existing user accounts and auth tokens.

Then, you can configure another local security provider. For help setting one up, see xref:security-providers.adoc[]
