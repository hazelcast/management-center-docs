= Management Center Configuration Tool
:page-aliases: ROOT:mc-conf.adoc
:description: The Management Center Configuration Tool (mc-conf) is a command line tool that allows you to automate processes that require configuring Management Center, without using the UI.

The Management Center Configuration Tool (`mc-conf`) is a command line tool that allows you to automate processes that require configuring Management Center, without using the UI.

This tool makes changes to the configuration settings in the `hazelcast-mc` directory of the user's home directory. As a result, the tool must be used on the same device as the Management Center web application is deployed and Management Center must not be running while using the tool.

== Getting Started

To use the `mc-conf` tool, execute the `mc-conf` script in the `bin/` directory of the Management Center distribution. This script is available as a shell script (`mc-conf.sh`) for Linux and macOS or a batch file (`mc-conf.bat`) for Windows.

. Make sure that Management Center is not running.
+
You cannot use this tool while Management Center is running.

. To see all available commands, execute the `mc-conf` script with no
arguments.

TIP: If you've set a non-default home directory with the xref:system-properties.adoc#hazelcast-mc-home[`hazelcast.mc.home` property], you must provide the path to the home directory with the `-H` or `--home` options.

== Skipping the Check for a Lock File

When you execute `mc-conf.sh` or `mc-conf.bat`, the script checks if Management Center is running by looking for a lock file called `mc.lock` in the Management Center home directory. If the `mc.lock` file is found, the script exits with an error. You can disable this check by starting Management Center with the xref:system-properties.adoc#hazelcast-mc-lock-skip[`hazelcast.mc.lock.skip` property].

[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_OPTS='-Dhazelcast.mc.lock.skip=true'
mc-conf.sh ...
----

This property can be useful when you run Management Center on Kubernetes, and the home directory is on a mounted persistent volume. In this case when Kubernetes restarts the container for any reason, the `mc.lock` file won't be deleted, therefore the next startup will be prevented due to the lock file.

== Hiding Sensitive Configuration in the UI

The `set sensitive-properties` task configures the sensitive properties that must not be shown in plain text in Management Center.
`--hidden-properties` is a comma-separated list of member properties to be hidden in the member properties.
`--masked-config-properties` is a comma-separated list of XPath expressions in the member configuration to be masked.

== Secure Interactive Prompt for Passwords

By default, passwords are displayed in the console as you type. If you want to hide your password from the console, you can use a secure interactive prompt.

To use a secure interactive prompt, enter the `password` option without providing a value. For example, instead of
`--password=<password>`, use `--password`.

When you use the `--password` option without providing a value, you will get a prompt to enter a value on the console.

```bash
mc-conf.sh user update-password --username=admin --password
Enter value for --password (Password for the user record. Provide value directly,
or use without value to enter securely with interactive prompt.): ********
Successfully changed password for user 'admin'.
```

As you see in the above example, the password input is not echoed to the console
since it is provided with the secure interactive mode.

== Argument Files

When an
argument beginning with the character `@` is encountered, it is treated as a path
leading to a text file. The contents of that file are automatically expanded into
the current task. An example of the argument file usage is shown below.

```bash
mc-conf.sh user update-password @arg-file.txt
Successfully changed password for user 'admin'.
cat arg-file.txt
--username=admin --password=mnb3c4s0
```
