* The link:https://www.pendo.io/[Pendo] JavaScript library collects data from Management Center web pages to generate activity reports and to analyze the performance of the Management Center frontend. Pendo is included in all Management Center web pages. For more information, see link:https://www.pendo.io/legal/privacy-policy/[Pendo's Privacy Policy].
