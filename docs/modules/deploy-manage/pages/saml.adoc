== Set up the SAML security provider

To set up SAML, you need to configure settings either in the UI or the `hz-mc conf` tool.

[tabs] 
====
UI::
+
--
Go to *Settings* > *Security Providers* > *SAML*.

image:ROOT:ConfigureSAML.png[SAML Configuration]
--
mc-conf::
+
--
Use the `saml configure` task. For help, use the `-h` flag or see xref:mc-conf.adoc[].

.Linux and Mac
```bash
hz-mc conf saml configure
```

.Windows
```bash
mc-conf.bat saml configure 
```

* **Relying Party Identifier:** The application-defined unique identifier that is
the intended audience of the SAML assertion. This is most often the Service Provider
Entity ID of your application.
* **Post Back URL:** URL of the Management Center SAML assertion consumer, including schema
(`http://` or `https://`) and port. Assertion consumer is located under the path `/saml/sso`
so you should append `/saml/sso` to the Management Center URL. Your Identity Provider should
have access to this URL as it will post back SAML responses to it. For example, if Management
Center and the Identity Provider are on the same machine, you would enter
`\http://127.0.0.1:8080/saml/sso``.
* **Group Attribute:** Name of the attribute that contains group of the user.
* **Identity Provider Metadata:** Your Identity Provider's metadata in XML format.
* **Group Name Separator:** Separator for the group names in case the group
attribute value contains more than one group.
* **Admin Groups:** Members of this group have admin privileges on the Management Center. To use more
than one group, separate them with the group name separator you have configured.
* **User Groups:** Members of this group have read and write privileges on the Management Center.
To use more than one group, separate them with the group name separator you have configured.
* **Read-only User Groups:** Members of this group have only read privilege on the Management
Center. To use more than one group, separate them with the group name separator you have configured.
* **Metrics-only Groups:** Members of this group have the privilege to see only the metrics
on the Management Center. To use more than one group, separate them with the group name separator
you have configured.

NOTE: If the user has more than one authority, Management Center uses the highest one.

Once you configure SAML, a button for single sign-on will be shown in the login page. Clicking it will
start the SAML single sign-on process. If you don't have an existing session with your identity provider,
you will be taken to the login page of your identity provider. Once you log into your identity provider,
you will be redirected back to Management Center as a logged in user.

NOTE: If your identity provider needs service provider metadata XML, you can use the `saml/metadata` endpoint
to view/download it once you configure SAML. For example, `\http://localhost:8080/saml/metadata`.

== Create and manage users

To create and manage additional users, you must register them with your identity provider.

When creating users, be sure to give them a valid role. See xref:user-management.adoc[].
