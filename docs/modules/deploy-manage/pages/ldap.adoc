== Setting Up the LDAP Security Provider

To set up LDAP, you need to configure settings either in the UI or the `mc-conf` tool.

[tabs] 
====
UI::
+
--
To set up the LDAP security provider in the UI, go to *Settings* > *Security Providers* > *LDAP*.

--
mc-conf::
+
--
Use the `ldap configure` task. For help, use the `-h` flag or see xref:mc-conf.adoc[].

.Linux and macOS
```bash
mc-conf.sh ldap configure
```

.Windows
[source,bash]
----
mc-conf.bat ldap configure

====

* **URL:** URL of your LDAP server, including schema
(`ldap://` or `ldaps://`) and port.
* **Distinguished name (DN) of user:** DN of a user that has admin
privileges on the LDAP server. It is used to connect to the server
when authenticating users.
* **User DN:** DN to be used for searching users.
* **Group DN:** DN to be used for searching groups.
* **Admin Group(s):** Members of this group and its nested groups
have admin privileges on the Management Center. To use more than one group,
separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **User Group(s):** Members of this group and its nested groups have
read and write privileges on the Management Center. To use more than one
group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **Read-only User Group(s):** Members of this group and its nested groups
have only read privilege on the Management Center. To use more than
one group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **Metrics-only Groups:** Members of this group and its nested groups
have the privilege to see only the metrics on the Management Center.
To use more than one group, separate them with a semicolon (;).
* **Start TLS:** Enable if your LDAP server uses **Start TLS** operation.
* **User Search Filter:** LDAP search filter expression to search for
the users. For example, `uid=\{0\}` searches for a username that matches with
the `uid` attribute.
+
NOTE: You can use the xref:system-properties.adoc#hazelcast-mc-ldap-timeout[`hazelcast.mc.ldap.timeout` property] to
specify connect and read timeout values for LDAP search queries.
It is in milliseconds and its default value is `3000` milliseconds.
* **Group Search Filter:** LDAP search filter expression to search for
the groups. For example, `uniquemember=\{0\}` searches for a group that
matches with the `uniquemember` attribute.
* **Nested Group Search:** Disable if you have a large LDAP group structure
and it takes a long time to query all nested groups during login.

NOTE: Values for **Admin**, **User**, **Read-only** and **Metrics-Only** group names must
be given as plain names. They should not contain any LDAP attributes such
as `CN`, `OU` and `DC`.

== Creating and Managing Users

To create and manage additional users, you must configure them on the LDAP server.

When creating users, be sure to give them a valid role. See xref:user-management.adoc[].

== Updating LDAP Settings

Once configured, LDAP settings are saved in a local database managed by Management Center.
If you need to update your settings afterwards, you need to provide the import properties file under `<hazelcast-mc>/import/securityHotReload.properties`, and then click on the **Reload Security Config** button on the login page.
The `securityHotReload.properties` should contain the following properties:

```
url=<Ldap URL>
username=<Distinguished name (DN) of user>
password=<password>
userDn=<User DN>
groupDn<Group DN>
startTls=<true|false>
adminGroup=<Admin group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
userGroup=<Read-write group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
readonlyUserGroup<Read-only group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
metricsOnlyGroup<Metrics-only group(s). Use ';' to separate multiple groups>
userSearchFilter=<User Search Filter>
groupSearchFilter=<Group Search Filter>
nestedGroupSearch=<true|false>
```

NOTE: The **Reload Security Config** button will only appear
when the `<hazelcast-mc>/import/securityHotReload.properties` file is present.
After a successful import, the file will be renamed as `importedSecurityHotReload-<import_timestamp>.properties.bak`.

Alternatively, you can use the `mc-conf` tool's `security reset` and `ldap configure` tasks to
configure the LDAP security provider from scratch,
but you need to stop Management Center for this configuration option.
See xref:deploy-manage:mc-conf.adoc[] for more information.

[[ldap-ssl]]
== Enabling TLS/SSL for LDAP

If your LDAP server is using `ldaps` (LDAP over SSL) protocol or the *Start TLS* operation, use the following system properties for your Management Center deployment:

* `hazelcast.mc.ldap.ssl.trustStore`: Path to the truststore. This
truststore needs to contain the public key of your LDAP server.
* `hazelcast.mc.ldap.ssl.trustStorePassword`: Password of the truststore.
* `hazelcast.mc.ldap.ssl.trustStoreType`: Type of the truststore. Its default value is JKS.
* `hazelcast.mc.ldap.ssl.trustManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm
based on which the authentication keys are provided. System default is used
if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling the
`javax.net.ssl.TrustManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.

[[password-encryption]]
== Password Encryption

By default, the password that you use in the LDAP configuration is stored in a plain text in a local database.
This might pose a security risk.
To store the LDAP password in an encrypted form, we offer the following options:

* **Provide a keystore password:** This creates and manages a Java
keystore under the Management Center home directory. The LDAP password
is stored in this keystore in an encrypted form.
* **Configure an external Java keystore:** This uses an existing Java
keystore. This option might also be used to store the password in an HSM
that provides a Java keystore API.

In the case of using either one of the options, the LDAP password you enter
on the initial configuration UI dialog will be stored in an encrypted form in a
Java keystore instead of the local database.

NOTE: You can also encrypt the password, and provide it in an encrypted form,
when configuring LDAP security provider.
See xref:deploy-manage:variable-replacers.adoc[] for more information.

[[providing-a-master-key-for-encryption]]
=== Providing a Master Key for Encryption

There are two ways to provide a master key for encryption:

* If you deploy Management Center on an application server,
set the `MC_KEYSTORE_PASS` environment variable before starting Management
Center. This option is less secure. You should clear the environment
variable once you make sure you can log in with your LDAP credentials
to minimize the security risk.
* If you're starting Management Center from the command line, you can
start it with the `hazelcast.mc.askKeyStorePassword` property. Management Center
asks for the keystore password upon start and uses it as a password
for the keystore it creates. This option is more secure as it only stores
the keystore password in memory.

By default, the Management Center creates a Java keystore file under the
Management Center home directory with the name `mc.jceks`. You can
change the location of this file by using the
`hazelcast.mc.keyStore.path` property.

[[configuring-an-external-java-keystore]]
=== Configuring an External Java KeyStore

If you don't want Management Center to create a keystore for you and
use an existing one that you've created before (or an HSM), set the
following system properties when starting Management Center:

* `hazelcast.mc.useExistingKeyStore=true`: Enables use of an existing keystore.
* `hazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.path=/path/to/existing/keyStore.jceks`: Path
to the keystore. You do not have to set it if you use an HSM.
* `hazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.pass=somepass`: Password for the keystore.
You do not have to set it if HSM provides another means to unlock HSM.
* `hazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.type=JCEKS`: Type of the keystore.
* `hazelcast.mc.existingKeyStore.provider=com.yourprovider.MyProvider`: Provider
of the keystore. Leave empty to use the system provider. Specify the class name
of your HSM's `java.security.Provider` implementation if you use an HSM.

NOTE: Make sure your keystore supports storing secret keys.

[[updating-encrypted-passwords]]
== Updating Encrypted Passwords

You can use the ` ldap update-password` task in the `mc-conf` tool to update
the encrypted LDAP password stored in the keystore.

This command expects information about the keystore such as its location and
password and the new LDAP password that you want to use. After updating the LDAP password, you need to click
on the **Reload Security Config** button on the Management Center login page.
