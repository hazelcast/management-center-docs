In this tutorial, you'll learn how to start an open-source edition of Management Center, using Docker. You'll complete the following steps:

* Start a cluster with three members
* Start Management Center in Dev Mode on your local
* Connect Management Center to the cluster
* Create a map and query it using the SQL browser console
* Monitor the map

For convenience, the tutorial uses Docker for starting a Hazelcast cluster and Management Center.

IMPORTANT: Management Center without a license lets you monitor a Hazelcast cluster
having at most three members.

== Before You Begin

|===

== Step 1. Start Management Center

Use the following command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hazelcast/management-center:{full-version}
----

You should see the following terminal log:

image:ROOT:MC-starts.png[Management Starts successfully]

In a web browser, go to localhost:8080 and enable Dev Mode.

You've now launched the Management Center user interface in Dev Mode:

See xref:launching:dev-mode.adoc[Dev Mode] for details on the development mode.

== Step 2. Connect to the Cluster

Click on the "Connect" box seen in the above screenshot

image:ROOT:ConnectToCluster.png[Connecting to the Hello World Cluster]

Type in the name of cluster, and members' IP addresses and ports.
It is recommended to enter more than one member address in case that member is no longer available in the future.
You should see the established connection between Management Center and the cluster once the "Connect" button is hit:

Click on the "View Cluster" button to see the cluster's dashboard:

See xref:monitor-imdg:dashboard.adoc[here] for the details of cluster dashboard screen.

== Step 3. Create a Map

Let's create a map in the cluster and put some data in it using SQL.
In a new terminal, use the following Docker command to switch to the SQL shell:

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --network hazelcast-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast:{full-version} hz-cli --targets hello-world@172.18.0.2:5701 sql
----

In the SQL shell, create the map called `my_distributed_map` with the following command:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MAPPING my_distributed_map TYPE IMap OPTIONS ('keyFormat'='varchar','valueFormat'='varchar');
----

Then put some data into the map:

[source,sql]
----
SINK INTO my_distributed_map VALUES
   ('1', 'John'),
   ('2', 'Mary'),
   ('3', 'Jane');
----

Exit the SQL shell with the `exit` command.

== Step 4. Monitor the Map

Go to *Storage* > *Maps* in Management Center, and select *my_distributed_map*
from the list of maps. You can now see the statistics of your map:

== Step 5. Query the Map

Click *SQL Browser* in the toolbar and select *my_distributed_map*
in the *select a map* field. The browser puts the map's name in the default `SELECT * FROM` SQL command.

Click the *Execute Query* button. The result should look like the following:
