= Enterprise

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to start a licensed Management Center, using Docker. You'll complete the following steps:

* Start a Hazelcast Enterprise cluster
* Start a local Management Center with TLS enabled
* Connect Management Center to the cluster

For convenience, the tutorial uses Docker for starting a Hazelcast cluster and Management Center.

== Step 1. Start Management Center

In this step, you are going to start a local Management Center service with TLS enabled.
To be able to use TLS, a key material is required; you will use a self-signed certificate for this purpose.

. Create a directory in which the certificate will reside.
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir keystore
----

. Create the key pairs.
+
[source,shell]
----
keytool -validity 365 -genkeypair -alias server -keyalg EC -keystore ./keystore/server.keystore -storepass 123456 -keypass 123456 -dname CN=localhost
----
. Store the certificate in a file (`server.crt`).
+
[source,shell]
----
keytool -export -alias server -keystore ./keystore/server.keystore -storepass 123456 -file ./keystore/server.crt
----
. Add the certificate to keystore.
+
[source,shell]
---- 
keytool -import -noprompt -alias server -keystore ./keystore/server.truststore -storepass 123456 -file ./keystore/server.crt
----
+
Your self-signed certificate is now ready to use. 
. Go to the directory where you extracted the Management Center binary package
and start Management Center.
+
[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.enabled=true -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStore=<path to the directory that contains the keystore directory>/keystore/server.keystore -Dhazelcast.mc.tls.keyStorePassword=123456 -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

In the terminal, you should see a log message showing that Management Center is started.

[source,shell]
----
Hazelcast Management Center successfully started at https://localhost:8443/
----

== Step 2. Connect Management Center to Cluster

. In your preferred browser, go to \https://localhost:8443/ and enable *Dev Mode*.
+
NOTE: The browser may show the "Your connection is not secure" message. This is because of the
self-signed certificate not being trusted by the browser. You can fix this by adding this certificate
to the trusted certificates list of the browser (usually by clicking on *Not Secure* in the address bar and
selecting *Always Trust* for the `localhost` listing).
. Click *Connect* and enter your clusterâ€™s name and the IP addresses of all cluster members.
+

+
You should see the established connection between the secured Management Center and Enterprise cluster.

== Next Steps

You can now work on Management Center as described in xref:start-opensource.adoc#step-3-create-a-map[creating a map] and xref:start-opensource.adoc#step-5-query-the-map[querying it].
