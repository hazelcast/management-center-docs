= Configuring Clustered JMX

In order to configure Clustered JMX, use the following
command line parameters for your Management Center deployment.

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true` (default is false)
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=9000` (optional, default is 9999)
* `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false`
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.rmi.port=9001` (optional, default is 9998)
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.host=localhost` (optional, default is server's host name)

With embedded Jetty, you do not need to deploy your
Management Center application to any container or application server.

You can start the Management Center application with
Clustered JMX enabled as shown below.

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=9999
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

Once the Management Center starts, you should see a log
similar to the one below:

[source,bash]
----
2021-09-09 22:34:19,333 [ INFO] [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-19] [c.h.w.s.j.i.JMXServiceImpl]: Starting Management Center JMX Service on port: 9999
----

You should be able to connect to the Clustered JMX interface
using the address `localhost:9999`.

You can use `jconsole` or any other JMX client to monitor your
Hazelcast cluster. As an example, below is the `jconsole`
screenshot of the Clustered JMX hierarchy.

== Enabling TLS/SSL for Clustered JMX

By default, Clustered JMX is served unencrypted. To enable
TLS/SSL for Clustered JMX, use the following command line
parameters for your Management Center deployment:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl=true` (default is false)
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStore=path to your keystore`
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStorePassword=password for your keystore`

The following is an example on how to start the Management Center
with a TLS/SSL enabled Clustered JMX service on port 65432:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=65432
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStore=/some/dir/selfsigned.jks
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourpassword
-jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

NOTE: You can encrypt the keystore password and pass it as a
command line argument in encrypted form for improved security.
See the xref:configuring.adoc#variable-replacers[Variable Replacers section] for more information.

Then, you can use the following command to connect to the
Clustered JMX service using JConsole with the address `localhost:65432`:

[source,bash]
----
jconsole -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/some/dir/selftrusted.ts -J-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=trustpass
----

=== Enabling TLS Mutual Authentication for Clustered JMX

In order to secure the Clustered JMX interface, you can use
the following command line parameters to enable TLS mutual
authentication:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.mutualAuthentication=true` (default is false)
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.trustStore=path to your truststore`
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.trustStorePassword=password for your truststore`

The following is an example on how to start Management Center
with a TLS mutual authentication enabled Clustered JMX service on port 65432:

[source,bash]
----
java -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=65432
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.mutualAuthentication=true
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStore=/some/dir/selfsigned.jks
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourpassword
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.trustStore=/some/dir/truststore.jks
-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword
-jar hazelcast-management-center-{page-component-version}.jar
----

=== Additional TLS/SSL Configuration Options

The following are some additional command line arguments
that you can use to configure TLS/SSL for clustered JMX:

* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyStoreType`: Type of the keystore. Its default
value is JKS.
* `-Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.ssl.keyManagerAlgorithm`: Name of the algorithm based
on which the authentication keys are provided.
The system default is used if none is provided. You can find out the default by calling
the `javax.net.ssl.KeyManagerFactory#getDefaultAlgorithm` method.
