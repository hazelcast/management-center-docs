= Integrating with AppDynamics

Use the Clustered JMX interface to integrate the Hazelcast Management Center
with *AppDynamics*. To perform this integration, attach the AppDynamics
Java agent to the Management Center.

For agent installation, see the
http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO14S/Install%2Bthe%2BApp%2BAgent%2Bfor%2BJava[Install the App Agent for Java] page.

For monitoring on AppDynamics, see the
http://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO14S/Monitor%2BJMX%2BMBeans#MonitorJMXMBeans-UsingAppDynamicsforJMXMonitoring[Using AppDynamics for JMX Monitoring] page.

After installing AppDynamics agent, you can start the Management Center as shown below:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
java -javaagent:/path/to/javaagent.jar \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.enabled=true \
     -Dhazelcast.mc.jmx.port=9999 -jar hazelcast-management-center-{full-version}.jar
----

When the Management Center starts, you should see the logs below:

```
Started AppDynamics Java Agent Successfully.
Hazelcast Management Center starting on port 8080 at path : /
```
