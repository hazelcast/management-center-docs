= Updating Cluster Configuration at Runtime
:description: You can add YAML or XML configuration blocks to your running cluster, without needing to restart it.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

Go to *Administration* > *Update Config*.

== Supported Configuration

Management Center allows you to add configuration for the following at runtime.

TIP: A configuration block is one that is a direct child of `hazelcast`.

- New data structure blocks
+
NOTE: You cannot add map indexes, using the *Update Config* page. To add map indexes, use the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:sql:create-index.adoc[`CREATE INDEX`] statement in the xref:tools:sql-browser.adoc[SQL browser].

- New WAN Replication blocks

- New or updated Enterprise licenses

For examples of YAML and XML configuration, see the Hazelcast GitHub repository:

- https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/resources/hazelcast-full-example.yaml[YAML example]
endif::[]

endif::[]

== Submitting New Configuration to the Cluster 

You can add configuration blocks to the text field or you can upload a YAML or XML configuration file.

NOTE: If you submit an existing configuration block, other than `license`, 
that already exists, the cluster ignores that configuration block and applies only the new ones.

To check which configuration blocks will be applied, click the *Preview* button.

To apply the new configuration, click the *Submit* button.

When the configuration is submitted to the cluster, the cluster sends back one of the following results:

[cols="1s,2a"]
|===
|Status|Description

|Started
|Management Center successfully uploaded the configuration to the cluster.

|In Progress
|Management Center is uploading the configuration to the cluster. This is an intermediate result for large configuration blocks. You may not see this status if you submit small configuration blocks.

|Failed
|Some or all configuration blocks were not applied to the cluster.

|Finished
|The configuration was successfully applied to the cluster.

To view the applied changes or errors click the *Result* button.

== Troubleshooting

Use this section to find suggestions for resolving errors that may occur with dynamic configuration.

=== Failed Results

You will see a *Failed* result if some or all configuration blocks were not applied to the cluster.

Click on the *Results* button to see which configuration blocks were applied and which were ignored.

If you submit an existing configuration block, other than `license`, 
that already exists, the cluster ignores that configuration block and applies only the new ones.

=== Server request error

If you see the following error after submitting a configuration, make sure that you are submitting valid XML or YAML:

```
Server request error: An exception occurred: expected type: JSONObject, found: String.
```
