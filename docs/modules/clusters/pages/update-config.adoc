:description: You can add YAML or XML configuration blocks to your running cluster, without needing to restart it.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

Go to *Administration* > *Update Config*.

== Supported Configuration

Management Center allows you to add configuration for the following at runtime:

- New data structure blocks
+
NOTE: You cannot add map indexes at runtime, using the *Update Config* page. To add map indexes, use the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:sql:create-index.adoc[`CREATE INDEX`] statement in the xref:tools:sql-browser.adoc[SQL browser].

- New WAN Replication blocks

- New or existing Enterprise licenses 

TIP: A configuration block is one that is a direct child of `hazelcast`.

== Submitting New Configuration to the Cluster 

You can add configuration blocks to the text field or you can upload a YAML or XML configuration file.
