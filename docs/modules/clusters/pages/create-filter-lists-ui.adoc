= Deploying a Client Filter List from the UI
:description: You can define filter lists to allow or disallow client connections to clusters, using the Management Center UI.

{description}

== Before you Begin

Configure your Hazelcast clients with one or more failover clusters to make sure that disconnected clients can connect to another cluster. For a tutorial, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:getting-started:blue-green.adoc[].

You can deploy either an allow list or a deny list to a cluster, not both. If you deploy an allow list, the cluster disallows connections from any clients that aren't in the allow list. If you deploy a deny list, the cluster allows connections from any client that isn't in the deny list.

== Creating a Filter List

. Enable client filtering on the connected cluster.

. Click **New List**.

. Give the list a name, a status, and a type.

. In the entries section of the form, add one or more entries for the list, and click *Add Entry +*.

. Click **Save**.

The orange status indicator means that the list has not yet been deployed to the cluster.

== Deploying a Filter List to a Connected Cluster

. If you created an allow list, select the *Allow-list* tab to enter the allow mode. Or, if you created a deny-list, select the *Deny-list* tab to enter the deny mode.

. Click **Deploy Configuration** to deploy the filter lists in your selected mode.

. Click *Save and Deploy* to deploy the new list to the cluster.

== Disabling an Existing Filter List

To keep a filter list saved in Management Center, but remove it from the cluster, do the following:

. Click the **Edit** button on a list row.

. Change the *List Type* field to *Inactive*.

. Click *Save*.

== Deleting a Filter List

To delete an entire filter list from the cluster, do the following:

. Click the **Edit** button on a list row.

. Click *Delete this list and deploy* in the top-right corner.

NOTE: You can also disable client filtering to delete all filter lists from the cluster.
