Management Center automatically runs the healthcheck report at certain intervals. You can disable automatic runs by setting the `-Dhazelcast.mc.periodic.healthcheck.enabled`
system property to `false`.

To manually run a healthcheck, go to *Config Healthcheck* and click *Re-Run Healthcheck*.

== Ignoring Healthcheck Problems

Sometimes, minor differences in member configurations are acceptable, but the healthcheck report will still display a failed status. To hide failed healthcheck reports, you can
**IGNORE** the reported problems. The ignored problems will not show up again in successive healthcheck runs.

NOTE: Ignored healthcheck problems can not be unignored.
