Healthcheck provides various checks related to configuration semantics, environment, member config equality, and usage.

A new Healthcheck is performed upon navigation to the Healthcheck page. You can run all checks again using the `RUN HEALTHCHECK` button in the header.

== Healthcheck Status
Healthcheck categorizes the checks and problems with five different severities:

- *FAIL:* A check has the status `FAIL`, indicated by a red color, when the cluster exhibits at least one critical problem, signaling the need for urgent resolution to prevent system failure or compromise.
- *WARNING:* A check has the status `WARNING`, indicated by a yellow color, when the cluster exhibits at least one non-critical issue or potential concern that requires attention, but does not pose an immediate threat or failure.
- *INFO:* A check has the status `INFO`, indicated by a blue color, to inform the user about best practices that may be applied to enhance system performance, availability, or efficiency within the cluster.
- *PASS:* A check has the status `PASS`, indicated by a green color, if no violations found in the cluster.
- *DISABLED:* A check has the status `DISABLED`, indicated by a gray color, if a check is disabled by the user.

NOTE: If Prometheus Export is enabled, individual Healthcheck status counts are published via exporter periodically with `hz_healthcheck_status_` prefix. For further information on Prometheus Exporter, see xref:integrate:prometheus-monitoring.adoc[].

== Actions

Healthcheck provides several actions to be taken using the Actions dropdown in the header. These actions include the following:

- *Run Full Healthcheck:* When a regular Healthcheck is performed, disabled checks are typically ignored. However, this action specifically allows for the execution of a Healthcheck that includes the results of disabled checks.

NOTE: After running a Full Healthcheck, preview mode is enabled. When Healthcheck goes into preview mode, the user is not able to disable any check. Running regular Healthcheck disables the preview mode.

- *Download Report:* This action can be used to download the Healthcheck report in JSON format, for further analysis.
- *Reset Healthcheck Settings:* This action removes all information about disabled checks and data structures. After resetting the settings, Healthcheck will include all checks and data structures in the analysis.

== Filters

Healthcheck provides a mechanism to filter the results based on several attributes. These filters include the following:

- *Search:*
Healthcheck results can be filtered by searching for check ID, description, problematic member, and data structure.
- *Status Filter:*
You can keep track of the number of checks based on their statuses. Additionally, you can toggle the statuses on/off to filter the results in the report by clicking on the status buttons.
- *Category Filter:*
Healthcheck categorizes the checks by several attributes. The results can be filtered by enabling/disabling the checks in different categories, by using choose category dropdown in the header.

NOTE: ID of a check has a letter prefix about the related category.

If at least one filter is in use, all the filters can be cleared using the `Reset Filters` button.

== Healthcheck Problems

Individual check results can be inspected by clicking on the report item associated with a specific check. A report item may contain several problems of different statuses. A problem summary consists of a problem description
and advice to fix the issue.

== Disabling Checks
A check can be disabled when it is not critical, and omitting the check is feasible for a cluster. When a check is disabled, Healthcheck does not perform an operation about this particular check.
Healthcheck provides two disabling mechanisms:

*Disabling for the whole cluster:* A check can be disabled for the whole cluster by clicking on the checkbox in the details of a report item. Cluster-wide disabled check will not be performed on any member or data structure.

*Disabling for a specific data structure:* A check can be disabled for a specific data structure by clicking on the `Disable For` button inside a problem detail. Note that the check will be performed on the other data structures,
and it may still contain problems about other data structures.

NOTE: Disabling for a specific data structure works only for specific checks. This mechanism does not exist for every check.

Disabling a check causes the corresponding report item to move down the list. The details of a disabled check looks like the following:

A check may be further enabled for the whole cluster, or for a specific data structure from the report details of the disabled check.

- If a check is disabled cluster-wide, the checkbox inside the report details can be used to enable the check for the whole cluster.

- If a check is disabled for a specific data structure, details about the disabled data structures is shown in the report item. You can further enable the check for a specific data structure by clicking on the `Enable For` button inside
the problem details.
