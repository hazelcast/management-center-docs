= Diagnostic Logging
:description: Hazelcast offers an extended set of diagnostics plugins for both Hazelcast members and clients. A dedicated log file is used to write the diagnostics content, and a rolling file approach is used to prevent taking up too much disk space.

{description}

== Enabling Diagnostics Logging

To enable diagnostics logging, click the `Enable` button, configure the auto turn-off settings if desired, confirm the action, and wait until the process is finished.

=== Auto Turn-Off Configuration

When enabling diagnostic logging, you can configure an automatic turn-off duration to prevent logs from running indefinitely. This feature helps manage disk space and system resources.

- **Auto turn-off enabled**: Check this option to automatically disable diagnostic logging after a specified duration
- **Duration format**: Use the format `1d 23h 45m` (days, hours, minutes)
- **Maximum duration**: Up to 30 days (where a month is calculated as 30 days)
- **Default behavior**: If auto turn-off is disabled, diagnostic logging will run indefinitely until manually disabled

You must be an admin user to access this feature.

== Prerequisites and Limitations

- **Admin Access**: Only admin users can configure diagnostic logging settings
- **Dynamic Configuration**: This feature is only available when diagnostic logging can be configured dynamically. If diagnostic logging is configured via properties, it cannot be modified dynamically through the Management Center interface
- **Cluster Version**: Dynamic diagnostic logging configuration requires a minimum cluster version

== Diagnostic Logging Notifications

The Management Center displays notifications at the top of every page to keep you informed about diagnostic logging status:

=== When Diagnostic Logging is Enabled

- A persistent notification banner appears displaying "Diagnostic logging enabled"
- The banner includes a warning: "This may significantly increase the log volume"
- Shows the auto turn-off configuration (if enabled)
- Displays the timestamp when logging was enabled
- The notification remains visible until diagnostic logging is disabled

=== When Diagnostic Logging is Disabled

- A dismissible notification appears showing "Diagnostic logging was disabled at [timestamp]"
- Users can close this notification by clicking the close button
- Once dismissed, the notification won't appear again for the same disable event
- The system remembers your dismissal preference per user and cluster

NOTE: Notifications only appear when diagnostic logging can be configured dynamically

== Monitoring Diagnostic Logging Status

When diagnostic logging is active, the interface displays:

- **Auto turn-off configuration**: Shows the configured automatic turn-off duration
- **Enabled at**: Timestamp when diagnostic logging was last enabled
- **Disabled at**: Timestamp when diagnostic logging was last disabled (shown when logging is currently disabled)

These timestamps help track the logging activity history and are useful for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

== Disabling Diagnostics Logging

To disable diagnostics logging, click the `Disable` button and wait until the process is finished.

Diagnostic logging will also be automatically disabled when the configured auto turn-off duration expires, if this feature was enabled during setup.
