= Diagnostic logging
:description: Hazelcast offers an extended set of diagnostics plugins for both Hazelcast members and clients. A dedicated log file is used to write the diagnostics content, and a rolling file approach is used to prevent taking up too much disk space.

{description}

You can switch diagnostic logging on and off at runtime (known as _dynamic_ configuration) without having to restart the cluster. 

To prevent logs from running indefinitely, you can also switch diagnostic logging off automatically after a set period by configuring the auto turn-off feature in Management Center.

NOTE: Only admin users can configure diagnostic logging settings.

== Enable diagnostic logging

To enable diagnostic logging, click the `Enable` button, configure the auto turn-off settings if desired, confirm the action, and wait until the process is finished.

=== Configure auto turn-off

When enabling diagnostic logging, you can configure an automatic turn-off duration to prevent logs from running indefinitely.

- **Auto turn-off enabled**: Select this option to automatically disable diagnostic logging after a specified duration
- **Duration format**: Specify using the format `1d 23h 45m` (days, hours, minutes). Note that one month is calculated as 30 days
- **Auto turn-off disabled**: If auto turn-off is disabled, diagnostic logging will run indefinitely until manually disabled

NOTE: When diagnostic logging is enabled with auto turn-off, members that join the cluster later will start their own timers from zero. As a result, earlier members may stop diagnostics before the last joiner, leading to a temporary inconsistency. To keep the reported state accurate, Management Center restarts its diagnostics auto turn-off timer from zero whenever a new member joins while diagnostics is enabled. This ensures Management Center shows diagnostics as enabled as long as at least one member is still logging.

== Prerequisites and limitations

- **Admin only**: Only admin users can configure diagnostic logging settings
- **Dynamic configuration**: If diagnostic logging is configured in Hazelcast Platform via system properties (known as _static_ configuration), logging cannot be switched on and off dynamically through the Management Center interface and the following message will appear:

// Author's note - needs work. To Do
- **Cluster version**: Dynamic diagnostic logging configuration requires Hazelcast clusters version 6.0 or higher:

== Diagnostic logging notifications

To inform you about diagnostic logging status, the Management Center displays notifications at the top of every page.

=== When diagnostic logging is enabled

- A persistent notification banner appears displaying "Diagnostic logging enabled"
- The banner includes a warning: "This may significantly increase the log volume"
- Shows the auto turn-off configuration (if enabled)
- Displays the timestamp when logging was enabled
- The notification remains visible until diagnostic logging is disabled

=== When diagnostic logging is disabled

- A dismissible notification appears showing "Diagnostic logging was disabled at [timestamp]"
- This notification can be dismissed by clicking the close button
- Once dismissed, the notification won't appear again for the same disable event
- The system remembers your dismissal preference per user and cluster

NOTE: Notifications appear only when diagnostic logging is enabled via dynamic configuration

== Monitor diagnostic logging status

When diagnostic logging is active, the interface displays:

- **Auto turn-off configuration**: Shows the configured automatic turn-off duration
- **Enabled at**: Timestamp when diagnostic logging was last enabled
- **Disabled at**: Timestamp when diagnostic logging was last disabled (shown when logging is currently disabled)

These timestamps help track the logging activity history and are useful for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

NOTE: The logging state along with the **Enabled at** and **Disabled at** fields are presented on a best-effort basis and may not accurately represent the state of diagnostic logging across the entire cluster. For example, logging might still be enabled on some members even if the interface already shows "Disabled at"

== Disable diagnostic logging

To disable diagnostic logging, click the `Disable` button and wait until the process completes.

If auto turn-off is enabled, diagnostic logging will be disabled automatically when the configured duration expires.
