You should have a good understanding of CP subsystem in Hazelcast, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[] in the Platform documentation.

This page is available only to admin users.

NOTE: Lite members are not displayed in the dropdown list because they do not store data and cannot be promoted to CP members.

If everything goes well, a success message is displayed.
