= Change the cluster state
:description: Cluster states determine what cluster operations are available. By changing the state of a cluster, you can grant or restrict cluster operations such as migrations as well as change the behavior of those operations.

{description}

You may want to change a cluster's state to do the following: 

- Add multiple new members to the cluster without triggering repartitioning after each member joins.
- Perform maintenance on a cluster without triggering repartitioning.

== Before you begin

You should already understand the concept of cluster states. For details about cluster states, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:cluster-member-states.adoc[] in the Platform documentation.

You must be an admin user to use this feature.

== Change the state of a cluster

To change a cluster's state, go to *Administration* > *Cluster State* and select a state from the dropdown menu.

== Next steps

After changing the state of a cluster, you may want to shut it down and perform maintenance on it. To shut down a cluster, see xref:shutting-down-cluster.adoc[].

To trigger a hot backup of the persistence store, see xref:triggering-hot-backup.adoc[].
