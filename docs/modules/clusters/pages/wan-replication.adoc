You can use the *WAN Replication* menu item to check the status of WAN replication, synchronize map and cache data structures across clusters, and add dynamic configuration for WAN replication.

image:ROOT:WanReplication.png[Monitoring WAN Replication]

On this page, you see the **WAN Replication Configurations** that contain replication publishers.

* **Name**: Name of the WAN replication config.
* **State**: Current state of the WAN replication or publisher. See
<<changing-wan-publisher-state, Changing WAN Publisher State>> for the
list of possible WAN publisher states.
* **Members**: Count of WAN publishers on the cluster members.
+
Members = (Cluster Members) * (WAN publishers).
* **Max Queue Fill Ratio**: Maximum value of **Outbound Queue Fill Ratio** among the publishers.
* **Total Queue**: Sum of **Outbound Queue Size** from the publishers.

To see the replication publishers, click on a replication config.

For detailed information about the corresponding replication publisher, click *Show details*.

image:ROOT:WanReplicationPublishers.png[WAN Replication Publishers]

This page includes the following details:

* **Member**: Hazelcast cluster member that has a WAN publisher. Icon shows the connection state (red=disconnected/green=connected).
* **Action**: Pause, stop or resume replication of a member's
records. You can also clear the event queues in a member using
the *Clear Queues* action.  For example, if you know that the
target cluster is being shut down, decommissioned, or put out of use
and it will never come back, you may additionally clear the WAN queues
to release the consumed heap after the publisher has been switched. Or,
when a failure happens and queues are not replicated anymore, you could
manually clear the queues using the *Clear Queues* action.
* **State**: Shows current state of the WAN publisher on a member. See
<<changing-wan-publisher-state, Changing WAN Publisher State>> for the
list of possible WAN publisher states.
* **Events Published per Second**: Number of published events
per second. Please see the paragraph below.
* **Average Event Latency**: Average latency of sending a record
to the target from this member. See below for details.
* **Outbound Queue Fill Ratio**: Percentage of how full the outbound queue is. +
Outbound Queue Fill Ratio = (Outbound Queue Size / Outbound Queue Capacity) * 100
* **Outbound Queue Size**: Number of records waiting in the queue
to be sent to the target.

**Events Published per Second** and **Average Event Latency** are
based on the following internal statistics:

* Total published event count (TBEC): Total number of events that
are successfully sent to the target cluster since the start-up of the member.
* Total latency (TL): Grand total of each event's waiting time in
the queue, including network transmit and receiving ACK from the target.

Each member sends these two statistics to the Management Center at
intervals of 3 seconds (update interval). Management Center derives
**Events Published per Second** and **Average Event Latency** from
these statistics as formulated below:

Events Published per Second = (Current TBEC - Previous TBEC) / Update Interval

Average Event Latency = (Current TL - Previous TL) / (Current TBEC - Previous TBEC)

NOTE: **Outbound Queue Fill Ratio** is only available for version 5 and later of Hazelcast Platform clusters.
**Outbound Queue Fill Ratio** may briefly go over 100% if the outbound queue overflows.

[[changing-wan-publisher-state]]
== Change WAN publisher state

A WAN publisher can be in one of the following states:

* *Replicating* (default): State where both enqueuing new events are
allowed; enqueued events are replicated to the
target cluster.
* *Paused*: State where new events are enqueued but are not dequeued.
Some events which have been dequeued before
the state was switched may still be replicated to the target cluster,
but further events will not be
replicated.
* *Stopped*: State where neither new events are enqueued nor dequeued.
As with the *Paused* state, some events might
still be replicated after the publisher has switched to this state.
* *Mixed*: Applicable only to a replication or a publisher, not applicable to a publisher member.
State when members do not have the same state. For instance, two members are replicating
and one member is paused.

To change a WAN publisher's state, click the *Change State*
dropdown button on top right corner of the WAN Publisher Table.

[[wan-sync]]
== WAN sync

You can initiate a synchronization operation on a map for a specific
target cluster. This operation is useful if
two remote clusters lost their synchronization due to WAN queue overflow
or in restart scenarios.

Hazelcast provides the following synchronization options:

. Default WAN synchronization operation: All the data of a map is sent to a target cluster to align the state of the target map with the
source map. See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:wan:advanced-features.adoc#synchronizing-wan-clusters[Synchronizing WAN Clusters]
for more information.
. WAN synchronization using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree[Merkle trees]: To
initiate this type of synchronization, you need to configure the
cluster members. See
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:wan:advanced-features.adoc#delta-wan-synchronization[Delta WAN Synchronization] 
in the Hazelcast documentation for details about configuring them. Make sure
you meet xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:wan:advanced-features.adoc#requirements-for-delta-wan-sync[all the requirements]
to use Delta WAN Synchronization and perform the configuration on both the source and target clusters.

To initiate WAN Sync, open the **WAN Replication** menu item on the left
and navigate to the **Sync** tab.

image:ROOT:WanSyncTab.png[WAN Sync Tab]

Select *Endpoint*(replication config), *Target*(publisher), and one or more *Maps*(configured with the selected replication)
and click **Sync** to start the operation.

image:ROOT:WanSyncConfig.png[WAN Sync Config]

You can also use the *Select All* option in the Maps dropdown 
to synchronize all the maps in source and target cluster.

Once you initiate the sync, you'll see the WAN Sync status entry shown in the table below:

image:ROOT:WanSyncOperation.png[WAN Sync Operation]

To see the progress of the sync, click on *See details*.

[[wan-consistency-check]]
=== WAN Consistency Check

You can check if a map is in sync with a specific target cluster.
Configure the same options as for the WAN Sync and click
**CHECK** to start the operation. +
You can see the WAN Sync status entry in the table below once you initiate the sync:

image:ROOT:WanConsistencyCheckOperation.png[WAN Consistency Check Operation]

You can see the details of the consistency check if you click on *See details*:

image:ROOT:WanConsistencyCheckProgress.png[WAN Consistency Check Progress]

NOTE: You need to use Merkle trees for WAN synchronization to 
check for consistency between two
clusters. You must configure the Merkle trees on both the source and
target clusters. If you do not configure it for the source
cluster, consistency check is ignored. If it's enabled for the
source cluster but not for the target cluster,
all entries are reported as if they need a sync, because a sync
operation will be a full sync in the absence of
Merkle trees.

[[add-temporary-wan-replication-config]]
=== Add temporary WAN replication configuration

You can add a temporary WAN replication configuration dynamically to a
cluster. It is useful for having one-off
WAN sync operations. The added configuration is not persistent, so it does not survive a member restart.

If you configure a data structure to use the new WAN configuration, entries added after the configuration change
are automatically replicated by the new WAN replication configuration.

image:ROOT:AddWanReplicationConfiguration.png[Add Temporary WAN Replication Configuration]

After clicking the **Add Configuration** button, the new WAN replication configuration
is added to the cluster.
You can see the new configuration when you try to initiate a WAN sync operation, as
described in the previous section.
