== Trigger a Rolling Upgrade

. Upgrade Management Center to the new version.
+
NOTE: Management Center is compatible with the previous minor version of Hazelcast. For example, Management Center 5.2 works with both Hazelcast 5.1 and 5.2. To change your cluster version to 5.2, you need Management Center 5.2.

. Upgrade the codebase of each Hazelcast member. Follow the steps described in the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc#rolling-upgrade-procedure[Platform documentation].

. Go to *Administration* > *Rolling Upgrade* and click *Upgrade Cluster*.

[NOTE]
====
Management Center can offer 3 types of rolling upgrades:

* For version 4.2: The upgrade will be to 5.0.
* For versions below 5.x and other than 4.2: Upgrade will be made to the next minor version. Example: For version 4.1, upgrade will be to 4.2.
* For versions above and equal to 5.x: Since version 5.5 is Long Term Support, multiple version upgrade is possible. Example: If the cluster version is 5.3 and all member versions are equal and above 5.5, the upgrade will be made to 5.5. If any member version is below than 5.5, upgrade will be made to the next minor version.
