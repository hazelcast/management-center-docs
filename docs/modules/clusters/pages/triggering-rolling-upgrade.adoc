== Trigger a Rolling Upgrade

. Upgrade Management Center to the new version.
+
NOTE: Management Center is compatible with the previous minor version of Hazelcast. For example, Management Center 5.2 works with both Hazelcast 5.1 and 5.2. To change your cluster version to 5.2, you need Management Center 5.2.

. Upgrade the codebase of each Hazelcast member. Follow the steps described in the xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc#rolling-upgrade-procedure[Platform documentation].

. Go to *Administration* > *Rolling Upgrade* and click *Upgrade Cluster*.

[NOTE]
====
Management Center can offer the following types of rolling upgrades:

* From version 4.2 to 5.0.
* From any version earlier than 5.x, excluding 4.2, to the next minor version. For example, from version 4.1 to 4.2.
* If members are already version 5.5, you can upgrade your cluster across multiple versions directly to the 5.5 long-term support version from any 5.x version. If any member version is earlier than 5.5, the cluster can only be upgraded to the next minor version.

When the cluster version is upgraded, you will see the following notification:
