= Triggering a Partial-Start
:description: You can trigger a partial-start to allow a cluster with persistence enabled to restart even if some members are missing after a cluster-wide restart.
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

Partial-Start is a procedure where a cluster starts without all members.
Data belonging to those missing members is assumed lost and Hazelcast tries
to recover missing data, using the restored backups. For example, if you have a minimum of two backups configured for all maps, then having at most two missing members will be safe against data loss. If more
than two members are missing or maps have fewer than two backups,
then data loss is expected.

== Before you Begin

To trigger a partial start, your cluster must be configured with one of the following data recovery policies:

- `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT`
- `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE`

Go to *Administration* > *Persistence* and check the *Cluster Status* field. Only trigger a partial-start if the cluster status is *In_Progress*, which means your cluster is missing a member.

To learn more about persistence in Hazelcast and what happens after a cluster-wide restart, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:storage:recover-single-member.adoc#what-happens-when-the-whole-cluster-restarts[What Happens When the Whole Cluster Restarts] in the Platform documentation.
