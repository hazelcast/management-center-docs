.Clients fields
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Name
|Name of the client instance.

|Address
|Local IP address, hostname, or canonical hostname of the client, depending on the <<client-address-types, client address filter>>.

|Type
|Type of client. This field usually contains the client's programming language.

|Enterprise
|Whether the client is an Enterprise Java client. Although non-Java clients can also connect to Enterprise clusters, the Java client includes Enterprise features that non-Java clients do not.

|Member Connection
|The member that the client is
currently connected to. *All* means a client
is configured so that it may connect to all members of
a cluster, although the client may not have a connection to all
members all the time.

|Hazelcast Client Version
|Version of the client codebase.

|UUID
|Universally unique identifier of the client.

|Labels
|Any labels given to the client. You can use these labels to create filter lists that allow or deny the client's connections to the cluster. See xref:client-filtering.adoc[].

|===

== Available Data

By default, only basic information about connected clients is displayed. The
values for
other fields are shown as **N/A**.

To see all available information about a connected client in Management Center, the client
must have the `hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled` system
property set to `true`. See
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:clients:java.adoc#client-system-properties[Client System Properties]
in the Platform documentation. This property configures clients to send statistics to the cluster, which in turn, sends them to Management Center.

To configure how often client statistics are collected,
use the system property  `hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds`.

== MC-Client

All clusters have an entry for a client called *MC-Client-<your cluster name>*. This is the Management Center client that is connected to your cluster. Management Center uses this client to receive data from the cluster as well as send requests to it for operations such as shutting down members.

You cannot view any more details about this client other than what is displayed on the *Clients* page.

NOTE: The MC-Client is *not included* in the client count that is displayed in the xref:getting-started:user-interface.adoc#menu[left-hand menu] and the xref:deploy-manage:connecting-to-clusters-ui.adoc[Cluster Connections page]

== Client Address Types

By default, the hostname of the client is displayed in the *Address* column.

To display the client's IP address or the canonical hostname, use the **Address Type**
dropdown.

== Filtering Clients

To filter the displayed clients, use the *Search* bar in the right-hand corner.

To sort the
table, click on the column headers.

== Viewing Details about a Connected Client

Click on
a client name will open a new page for monitoring that client
on the right, as shown below.

[[client-heap-memory]]
=== Heap Memory Utilization

The *Heap Memory Utilization* chart shows the memory usage
on the selected client with three different metrics
(maximum, used and total memory) represented by different colors. You can open this
chart as a separate window using the image:ROOT:MaximizeChart.png[maximize] button placed at top right of it.

=== General

**General** is a dynamically updated window tab showing general
information about the client. Below are brief explanations
for each piece of information:

.General client statistics
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Name
|Name of the client instance.

|Address
|Local IP address, hostname, or canonical hostname of the client, depending on the <<client-address, client address filter>>.

|Type
|Type of client. This field usually contains the client's programming language.

|Enterprise
|Whether the client is an Enterprise Java client. Although non-Java clients can also connect to Enterprise clusters, the Java client includes Enterprise features that non-Java clients do not.

|Member Connection
|The member that the client is
currently connected to. *All* means a client
is configured so that it may connect to all members of
a cluster. The client may not have a connection to all
members all the time.

|Version
|Version of the client codebase.

|Last Connection to Cluster
|Date and time that the client last connected
to the cluster. This field is reset after each reconnection.

|Last Statistics Collection
|Date and time that statistics were last collected from the client.
|===

=== Runtime
[[run-time]]

Next to the **General** tab, the **Runtime** tab shows the following
values, which are collected from the default MXBeans in the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

NOTE: Some of these statistics may not be available for
your client's
JVM implementation or operating system. **N/A** is shown for these
types of statistics. Please refer to your
JVM or operating system documentation for further details.

.Client runtime statistics
[cols="10%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Number of Processors
|Number of processors available
to the client.

|Uptime
|Uptime of the client.

|Maximum Memory
|Maximum amount of memory that the
client will attempt to use.

|Total Memory
|Amount of total heap memory currently
available for current and future objects in the client.

|Free Memory
|Amount of free heap memory in the client.

|Used Memory
|Amount of used heap memory in the client.
|===

=== OS

Next to the **Runtime** tab, the **OS** tab shows statistics
about the operating system of the client. These values are
collected from the default MXBeans in the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

NOTE: Some of these statistics may not be available for
your client's
JVM implementation or operating system. **N/A** is shown for these
types of statistics. Please refer to your
JVM or operating system documentation for further details.

.Client operating system statistics
[cols="10%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Free Physical Memory
|Amount of free physical memory on the client device.

|Committed Virtual Memory	|Amount of virtual memory that
is guaranteed to be available to the running process.

|Total Physical Memory
|Total amount of physical memory on the client device.

|Free Swap Space
|Amount of free swap space, which
is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full.
If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full,
inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.

|Total Swap Space
|Total amount of swap space.

|Maximum File Descriptor Count
|Maximum number of file
descriptors, which is an integer that
uniquely represents an opened file in the operating system.

|Open File Descriptor Count
|Number of open file descriptors.

|Process CPU Time
|CPU time used by the process on which
the member (JVM) is running.

|System Load Average
|System load average for the last minute.
The system load average is the average over a period
of time of this sum:

```
(the number of runnable entities queued to the
available processors) + (the number of runnable
entities running on the available processors)
```

The way in which the
load average is calculated is differently, depending on the operating system, but it is typically a damped time-dependent average.

[[client-near-cache]]
=== Client Near Cache Statistics

The *Client Near Cache Statistics* tables show statistics related
to the Near Cache of a client for maps and caches.
