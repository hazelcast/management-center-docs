:description: Monitor each member in a cluster and perform management operations on any member such as running garbage collection (GC), taking a thread dump, and shutting it down.
:page-aliases: monitor-imdg:monitor-members.adoc

You can use the *Members* menu item to monitor each member in a cluster and perform management operations on any member such as running garbage collection (GC), taking a thread dump, and shutting it down.

|Field|Description

|Member
|The IP address and port of the member.

|Additional Info
|Displays an info icon if the member is a CP member or a warning icon if the member's runtime or hardware setup does not conform to our production recommendations. Hover over the icon to see the tooltip. For a list of production recommendations, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:ROOT:production-checklist.adoc[] in the Platform documentation. To monitor and manage the CP subsystem, see xref:cp-subsystem.adoc[].

|Scripting
|Whether scripting is enabled. See xref:tools:scripting.adoc[]

|Streaming
|Whether the Jet engine is enabled. See xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:configuration:jet-configuration.adoc[] in the Platform documentation.

|Slow Operations
|Whether the member has detected slow operations. See <<slow-operations, Slow Operations>> on this page.

|Hazelcast Version
|Version of the member codebase that the member is running.

|Owned Partitions
|Number of partitions that are owned by the member.

|OS Total Physical Memory
|Total amount of physical memory on the member.

|OS Committed Virtual Memory
|Amount of virtual
memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running member.

|OS Free Physical Memory
|Amount of free physical
memory on the member.

|OS CPU Load
|Recent CPU usage for the whole system represented as a percentage value.
0% means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time
observed, while `100%` means that all CPUs were actively running during
the recent period being observed.

|OS Max File Desc
|Maximum number of file
descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that uniquely
represents an opened file in the operating system.

|OS Open File Desc
|Number of open file descriptors.

== Filtering Members

To filter the displayed members, use the *Search* bar in the right-hand corner.

To sort the
table, click on the column headers.

== Viewing Details about a Member

To see more details about a particular member, click on the member's row in the table.

=== Actions

On each member, you can trigger the following actions:

* **Run GC**: Executes garbage collection on the
selected member. A notification stating that the GC execution was
successful is shown.
* **Thread Dump**: Takes a thread dump of the
selected member and shows it in a separate dialog.
* **Shutdown Member**: Shuts down the selected member.
* **Promote Member**: If the member is a lite member, this button promotes it to a data member.

[[utilization-charts]]
=== Graphs

The **Heap and Native Memory** chart shows the percentage
of CPU usage on the selected member. The **CPU Load and Used Memory** chart shows the memory usage on the
selected member. You can open
each chart as a separate dialog using
the maximize image:ROOT:MaximizeChart.png[maximize] button.

To customize the data displayed in the graphs, see xref:getting-started:graphs.adoc[]

=== Runtime

**Runtime** is a dynamically updated window tab
showing the processor number, the start and up
times, and the maximum, total and free memory
sizes of the selected member. These values are
collected from the default MXBeans in the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

NOTE: These descriptions may vary according to the JVM version or vendor.

.Member runtime statistics
[cols="20%s,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|Number of Processors
|Number of processors
available to the member (JVM).

|Start Time
|Start time of the member (JVM).

|Uptime
|Uptime of the member (JVM).

|Maximum Memory
|Maximum amount of memory that
the member (JVM) will attempt to use.

|Free Memory
|Amount of free memory in the member (JVM).

|Used Heap Memory
|Amount of used memory.

|Max Heap Memory
|Maximum amount of memory that can be used for memory management.

|Used Non-Heap Memory
|Amount of used memory.

|Max Non-Heap Memory
|Maximum amount of memory that can be used for memory management.

|Total Loaded Classes
|Total number of classes
that have been loaded since the member (JVM) has started execution.

|Current Loaded Classes
|Number of classes that
are currently loaded in the member (JVM).

|Total Unloaded Classes
|Total number of classes
unloaded since the member (JVM) has started execution.

|Total Thread Count
|Total number of threads created
and also started since the member (JVM) started.

|Active Thread Count
|Current number of live threads
including both daemon and non-daemon threads.

|Peak Thread Count
|Peak live thread count since the
member (JVM) started or peak was reset.

|Daemon Thread Count
|Current number of live daemon threads.

|OS Free Physical Memory
|Amount of free physical
memory.

|OS Committed Virtual Memory
|Amount of virtual
memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process.

|OS Total Physical Memory
|Total amount of physical memory.

|OS Free Swap Space
|Amount of free swap space. Swap space is used when the amount of physical
memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources
and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.

|OS Total Swap Space
|Total amount of swap space.

|OS Maximum File Descriptor Count
|Maximum number of file
descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that uniquely
represents an opened file in the operating system.

|OS Open File Descriptor Count
|Number of open file descriptors.

|OS Process CPU Time
|CPU time used by the process on
which the member (JVM) is running.

|OS Process CPU Load
|Recent CPU usage for the member
(JVM) process. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0.
A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads
from the member (JVM) process during the recent period of time
observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively
running threads from the member (JVM) 100% of the time during the
recent period being observed. Threads from the member (JVM) include
the application threads as well as the member (JVM) internal threads.

|OS System Load Average
|System load average for the last minute.
The system load average is the average over a period of time of this sum:
(the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors) + (the number of runnable entities running on the available processors). The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system specific
but it is typically a damped time-dependent average.

|OS System CPU Load
|Recent CPU usage for the whole system represented as a percentage value.
0% means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time
observed, while 100% means that all CPUs were actively running during
the recent period being observed.

[[member-properties]]
=== Properties

Next to the **Runtime** tab, the **Properties** tab shows the member's system properties.

=== Member Configuration

Management Center receives the member configuration in XML format. As a result, even if you used a different configuration format such as YAML, it will be displayed in XML.

To view a member's configuration:

. Click a member's row in the table.

. Scroll down to *Member Configuration* at the bottom of the page.

=== Slow Operations

If a member has slow operations, you can view the detected slow
operations which occurred on that member. The data is collected by the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:performance:slowoperationdetector.adoc[SlowOperationDetector].

To view slow operations for a member:

. Click a member's row in the table.

. Click on an entry in the **List of Slow Operations** table.
