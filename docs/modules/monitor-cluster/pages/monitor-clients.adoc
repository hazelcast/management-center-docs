= Monitoring Clients
[[monitoring-clients]]

You can use the **Clients** menu item to monitor
all the clients that are connected to your Hazelcast cluster.

Only basic information for clients, like client instance
name, address, type and labels, is shown by default. The
values for
other fields are shown as **N/A**. As a prerequisite for
seeing the full information, you need to enable the client
statistics before starting your clients. This can be done
by setting the `hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled` system
property to `true` on the *client*. Please see the
xref:imdg:clients:java.adoc#client-system-properties[Client System Properties section]
in the Hazelcast Reference Manual for more information.
After you enable the client statistics, you can monitor your
clients using the Management Center.

You can see a list of all the clients in your cluster by
clicking on the **Clients** menu item on the left panel.
A new page is
opened on the right, as shown below. The page has two tabs:
**Connection** and **Filter**. The Connection tab is opened by
default. This tab shows the list of all the clients. See the
<<changing-cluster-client-filtering, Changing Cluster Client Filtering section>>
for the Filter tab's description.

By default, hostname of the client is shown in the address
column. You can change it to show its IP address or its
canonical hostname instead by using the **Address Type**
combo box. Note that this will also cause the client details
page to show the IP address or the canonical hostname.

You can filter the clients shown and you can also sort the
table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
a client name will open a new page for monitoring that client
on the right, as shown below.

[[client-heap-memory]]The **Heap Memory Utilization** chart shows the memory usage
on the selected client with three different metrics
(maximum, used and total memory) represented by different colors. You can open this
chart as a separate window using the image:ROOT:MaximizeChart.png[maximize]
button placed at top right of it; this gives you a
clearer view of the chart.

[[general]]**General** is a dynamically updated window tab showing general
information about the client. Below are brief explanations
for each piece of information:

* **Name**: Name of the client instance.
* **Address**: Local IP address of the client that is used for
connecting to members.
* **Type**: Type of the client.
* **Enterprise**: Yes, if the client is an Hazelcast 
Enterprise client.
* **Member Connection**: Shows to which member a client is
currently connected to. Please note that *ALL* means a client
is configured so that it *might* connect to all members of
a cluster, i.e., it might not have a connection to all
members all the time.
* **Version**: Version of the client.
* **Last Connection to Cluster**: Time that the client connected
to the cluster. It is reset on each reconnection.
* **Last Statistics Collection**: Time when the latest update
for the statistics is collected from the client.
* **User Executor Queue Size**: Number of waiting tasks in the
client user executor.
* **Labels**: List of client labels (as defined by the client).

[[run-time]]Next to the **General** tab, the **Runtime** tab shows the
processor number, uptime, and maximum,
total and free memory sizes of the selected client. These
values are collected from the default MXBeans provided by the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs
and some explanations are below:

* **Number of Processors**: Number of processors available
to the client (JVM).
* **Up Time**: Uptime of the client (JVM).
* **Maximum Memory**: Maximum amount of memory that the
client (JVM) will attempt to use.
* **Total Memory**: Amount of total heap memory currently
available for current and future objects in the client (JVM).
* **Free Memory**: Amount of free heap memory in the client (JVM).
* **Used Memory**: Amount of used heap memory in the client (JVM).

[[os]]Next to the **Runtime** tab, the **OS** tab shows statistics
about the operating system of the client. These values are
collected from the default MXBeans provided by the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs and some
explanations are below:

* **Free Physical Memory**: Amount of free physical memory.
* **Committed Virtual Memory**:	Amount of virtual memory that
is guaranteed to be available to the running process.
* **Total Physical Memory**: Total amount of physical memory.
* **Free Swap Space**: Amount of free swap space. Swap space
is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full.
If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full,
inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.
* **Total Swap Space**:	Total amount of swap space.
* **Maximum File Descriptor Count**: Maximum number of file
descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that
uniquely represents an opened file in the operating system.
* **Open File Descriptor Count**: Number of open file descriptors.
* **Process CPU Time**:	CPU time used by the process on which
the member (JVM) is running.
* **System Load Average**: System load average for the last minute.
The system load average is the average over a period
of time of this sum: (the number of runnable entities queued to the
available processors) + (the number of runnable
entities running on the available processors). The way in which the
load average is calculated is operating system
specific but it is typically a damped time-dependent average.

NOTE: Some of the Runtime/OS statistics may not be available for
your client's
JVM implementation/operating system. **N/A** is shown for these
types of statistics. Please refer to your
JVM/operating system documentation for further details.

[[client-near-cache]]The **Client Near Cache Statistics** table shows statistics related
to the Near Cache of a client. There are two separate
tables; one for maps and one for caches.

* **Map/Cache Name**: Name of the map or cache.
* **Creation Time**: Creation time of this Near Cache on the client.
* **Evictions**: Number of evictions of Near Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Expirations**: Number of TTL and max-idle expirations of Near
Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Hits**: Number of hits (reads) of Near Cache entries owned by
the client.
* **Misses**: Number of misses of Near Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Owned Entry Count**: Number of Near Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Owned Entry Memory Cost**: Memory cost of Near Cache entries
owned by the client.
* **LP Duration**: Duration of the last Near Cache key persistence
(when the pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Key Count**: Number of Near Cache key persistences (when the
pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Time**: Time of the last Near Cache key persistence (when the
pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Written Bytes**: Written number of bytes of the last Near Cache
key persistence (when the pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Failure**: Failure reason of the last Near Cache persistence
(when the pre-load feature is enabled).

NOTE: Please note that you can configure the time interval for which
the client statistics are collected and sent to the cluster,
using the system property  `hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds`.
See the
xref:imdg:clients:java.adoc#client-system-properties[System Properties section]
in the Hazelcast Reference Manual for more information.

[[changing-cluster-client-filtering]]
== Changing Cluster Client Filtering

NOTE: The Filter tab is only available with Hazelcast license
that includes the Cluster Client Filtering feature.

The **Filter** tab includes **Cluster Client Filtering** status,
**Cluster Client Filter Settings** and **Client Filtering
Lists** sections, as shown below.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringView.png[Client Filtering View]

The **Cluster Client Filtering** status section describes if there
is a deployed client filtering list available to all cluster
members (**Enabled** status), or if the feature is disabled for the
cluster and the members allow any clients (**Disabled** status).

The **Cluster Client Filter Settings** section allows to specify the
status of the feature and the filtering type and to deploy
any modifications made in client filtering lists to the deployed list
available to all cluster members. On the deploy action
the following happens:

* If the status to be deployed is **Disabled**, the deployed client
filtering list available to all cluster members is cleaned up
and the members start allowing any client to connect.
* If the status to be deployed is **Enabled**, all entries of the
matching lists from the Client Filtering Lists section are
copied into the deployed client filtering list and applied to
all cluster members. Matching lists are selected by
their status (**List Status** must be **Active**) and type (**List
Type** must match the value of the **Client Filter Type**
selection).

Once a cluster member receives the deployed client filtering list
from the Management Center, it immediately applies the list to
all currently connected clients and then uses it for newly connecting
clients. Deny-listed clients may connect to another cluster
if they are configured to support blue-green deployment. If they are not,
they shut down when denied access to the cluster. Please see the
xref:imdg:clients:java.adoc#blue-green-deployment-and-disaster-recovery[Blue-Green Deployment and Disaster Recovery section]
in the Hazelcast Reference Manual for more information.

NOTE: If some of the cluster members are not reachable from
the Management Center, those members keep using the last client
list applied to them.

The deploy action in the Cluster Client Filter Settings section is
available by clicking on the **Deploy Changes** button. 
The button is disabled if there are no changes in client
filtering lists that would lead to changes in the deployed
client filtering list as the result of the deploy.

There is also the **Summary** button. By clicking on the button a modal appears.
It shows a summary of what the effect of the deployed config will be.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringDeploySummary.png[Deploy Summary]

The **Client Filter Lists** section allows creation, editing and
deletion of the client filtering lists. To create a new client
filtering list, you need to click the **Add New List** button, which
will open the Create List form, as shown below. Once you
enter all fields and entries for the new list, click the **Save**
button to save your modifications.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringAddList.png[Add Client Filtering List]

The following formats of list entry values are supported:

* For the IP Address entry type you can specify IP address (IPv4 or
IPv6) with optional range characters (`\*` and `-`) instead of any
byte group. For instance, `10.3.10.*` refers to IPs between `10.3.10.0`
and `10.3.10.255`. The `10.3.10.4-18` refers to IPs between `10.3.10.4`
and `10.3.10.18` (4 and 18 included).
* For the Label entry type you can specify any string with optional
wildcard characters (`\*`). For instance, `green*` refers to any label
values that start with the `green` string.
* For the Instance Name entry type you can specify any string with
optional wildcard characters (`\*`). For instance, `*-client` refers
to any label values that end with the `-client` string.

To modify an existing client filtering list, you need to click the
**Edit** button, which will open the Edit List form,
as shown below.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringEditList.png[Edit Client Filtering List]

To delete an existing client filtering list, you need to click the
**Delete** button and confirm your action in the opened dialog.

NOTE: Any modifications made in the Client Filtering Lists section
will become available to members only after the deploy action.

NOTE: Deploying an empty allow list disconnects all clients.

[[changing-cluster-client-filtering-example]]
== Example Client Filtering

In this section we show how you can deploy your filtering list for better understanding.
In the beginning, the client filtering feature is disabled and there are no filter lists.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep1.png[Example Step 1]

Let's create a new filter list:

* We click the **New List** button and a screen with two forms appears.
* We fill the first form as follows:
** Filter Name: 'Example_allow_list'
** Filter Status: 'Active'
** Filter Type: 'Allow-list'
* Next we want to add two IP addresses to our soon-to-be allow-list.
To achieve this we need to fill the second form twice:
** First entry:
*** Type: 'IP Address'
*** Value: '1.2.3.4'
* We hit the **Add Entry** button.
** Second entry:
*** Type: 'IP Address'
***Value: '5.6.7.8'
* Again, we hit the **Add Entry** button.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep2.png[Example Step 2]

To save our brand new allow-list we hit the **Save** button. The allow-list is saved and we are redirected 
to client filtering overview as shown on the image bellow.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep3.png[Example Step 3]

In the **Client Filter Lists** we can see that our list has
a grey background, meaning it is not in use right now.
When we change **Filter Status** value to 'Enabled' and select **Filter Type**
as 'Allow-list', we are able to deploy our new allow-list; the **Deploy Changes** and **Summary** buttons
are enabled and our allow-list has a little cross 
in the **Deploy** column.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep4.png[Example Step 4]

Before deploying our allow-list, let's check what will be deployed
by clicking on the **Summary** button.
After the click, a modal opens; we can see that it contains our changes (two IP addresses, **1.2.3.4** and **5.6.7.8**).

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep5.png[Example Step 5]

Finally, let's deploy our changes by clicking the **Deploy Changes** button. 
After a brief moment, we have our allow-list deployed.
The **Deploy Changes** and **Summary** buttons become disabled again and our
list has no cross in the **Deploy** column
as there are no changes to be deployed.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep6.png[Example Step 6]
