= Monitoring Members
[[monitoring-members]]

Use this menu item to monitor each cluster
member and perform operations like running
garbage collection (GC) and taking a thread dump.

You can see a list of all the members in your
cluster by clicking on the **Members** menu item
on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

NOTE: You may see a warning icon with exclamation mark in the list
when your runtime or hardware configuration does not follow the performance
recommendations. See {imdg-ops-guide}[Hazelcast Deployment and Operations Guide]
for more information.

You can filter the members shown and you can also
sort the table by clicking on the column headers.
Members that participate in the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:cp-subsystem:cp-subsystem.adoc[CP subsystem]
are marked with the CP icon. Clicking on a member
name opens a new page for monitoring that
member on the right, as shown below.

[[member-operations]]You can perform the following operations on the selected member
using the buttons located at the top left of the page:

* **Run GC**: Executes garbage collection on the
selected member. A notification stating that the GC execution was
successful is shown.
* **Thread Dump**: Takes a thread dump of the
selected member and shows it in a separate dialog.
* **Shutdown Member**: Shuts down the selected member.
* **Promote Member**: It is only shown for the lite members.
When pressed, the lite member becomes a data member.

NOTE: Shutdown member operation requires enabled REST API in the Hazelcast cluster. See the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:clients:rest.adoc[Hazelcast documentation]
for more information.

Next to the above operation buttons, you can see the informative buttons
as described below:

* **Number of Owned Partitions**: Shows how many partitions are assigned
to the selected member.
* **Member Version**: Shows the Hazelcast cluster version which
the selected member belongs to.
* **CP Member UUID**: Shows CP member UUID if the member participates
in the CP subsystem of the cluster.

[[utilization-charts]]The **CPU Utilization** chart shows the percentage
of CPU usage on the selected member. The **Heap/Memory
Utilization** charts show the memory usage on the
selected member with three different metrics
(maximum, used and total memory). You can open
each chart as a separate dialog using
the image:ROOT:MaximizeChart.png[maximize] button
placed at top right of them; this gives you
a clearer view of the chart.

[[runtime]]**Runtime** is a dynamically updated window tab
showing the processor number, the start and up
times, and the maximum, total and free memory
sizes of the selected member. These values are
collected from the default MXBeans provided by
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Descriptions from
the Javadocs and some explanations are below:

* **Number of Processors**: Number of processors
available to the member (JVM).
* **Start Time**: Start time of the member (JVM)
in milliseconds.
* **Up Time**: Uptime of the member (JVM) in milliseconds
* **Maximum Memory**: Maximum amount of memory that
the member (JVM) will attempt to use.
* **Free Memory**: Amount of free memory in the member (JVM).
* **Used Heap Memory**: Amount of used memory in bytes.
* **Max Heap Memory**: Maximum amount of memory in
bytes that can be used for memory management.
* **Used Non-Heap Memory**: Amount of used memory
in bytes.
* **Max Non-Heap Memory**: Maximum amount of memory
in bytes that can be used for memory management.
* **Total Loaded Classes**: Total number of classes
that have been loaded since the member (JVM) has started execution.
* **Current Loaded Classes**: Number of classes that
are currently loaded in the member (JVM).
* **Total Unloaded Classes**: Total number of classes
unloaded since the member (JVM) has started execution.
* **Total Thread Count**: Total number of threads created
and also started since the member (JVM) started.
* **Active Thread Count**: Current number of live threads
including both daemon and non-daemon threads.
* **Peak Thread Count**: Peak live thread count since the
member (JVM) started or peak was reset.
* **Daemon Thread Count**: Current number of live daemon threads.
* **OS: Free Physical Memory**: Amount of free physical
memory in bytes.
* **OS: Committed Virtual Memory**: Amount of virtual
memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process in bytes.
* **OS: Total Physical Memory**: Total amount of physical memory in bytes.
* **OS: Free Swap Space**: Amount of free swap space
in bytes. Swap space is used when the amount of physical
memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources
and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.
* **OS: Total Swap Space**: Total amount of swap space in bytes.
* **OS: Maximum File Descriptor Count**: Maximum number of file
descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that uniquely
represents an opened file in the operating system.
* **OS: Open File Descriptor Count**: Number of open file descriptors.
* **OS: Process CPU Time**: CPU time used by the process on
which the member (JVM) is running in nanoseconds.
* **OS: Process CPU Load**: Recent CPU usage for the member
(JVM) process. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0.
A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads
from the member (JVM) process during the recent period of time
observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively
running threads from the member (JVM) 100% of the time during the
recent period being observed. Threads from the member (JVM) include
the application threads as well as the member (JVM) internal threads.
* **OS: System Load Average**: System load average for the last minute.
The system load average is the average over a period of time of this sum:
(the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors) + (the number of runnable entities running on the available processors). The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system specific
but it is typically a damped time-dependent average.
* **OS: System CPU Load**:
Recent CPU usage for the whole system represented as a percentage value.
`0%` means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time
observed, while `100%` means that all CPUs were actively running during
the recent period being observed.

NOTE: These descriptions may vary according to the JVM version or vendor.

[[member-properties]]Next to the **Runtime** tab, the **Properties** tab shows the system
properties.

The **Member Configuration** window shows the XML
configuration of the connected Hazelcast cluster.

[[slow-operations]]The **List of Slow Operations** gives an overview of detected slow
operations which occurred on that member. The data is collected by the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:performance:slowoperationdetector.adoc[SlowOperationDetector].

Click on an entry to open a dialog which shows the stacktrace and
detailed information about each slow invocation of this operation.
