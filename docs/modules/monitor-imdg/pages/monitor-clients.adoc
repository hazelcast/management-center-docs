= Monitoring Clients
[[monitoring-clients]]

You can use the **Clients** menu item to monitor
all the clients that are connected to your Hazelcast cluster.

Only basic information for clients, like client instance
name, address, type and labels, is shown by default. The
values for
other fields are shown as **N/A**. As a prerequisite for
seeing the full information, you need to enable the client
statistics before starting your clients. This can be done
by setting the `hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled` system
property to `true` on the *client*. Please see the
xref:imdg:clients:java.adoc#client-system-properties[Client System Properties section]
in the Hazelcast documentation for more information.
After you enable the client statistics, you can monitor your
clients using the Management Center.

You can see a list of all the clients in your cluster by
clicking on the **Clients** menu item on the left panel.
A new page is
opened on the right, as shown below. The page has two tabs:
**Connection** and **Filter**. The Connection tab is opened by
default. This tab shows the list of all the clients. See the
xref:client-filtering.adoc[Changing Cluster Client Filtering section]
for the Filter tab's description.

By default, hostname of the client is shown in the address
column. You can change it to show its IP address or its
canonical hostname instead by using the **Address Type**
combo box. Note that this will also cause the client details
page to show the IP address or the canonical hostname.

You can filter the clients shown and you can also sort the
table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking on
a client name will open a new page for monitoring that client
on the right, as shown below.

[[client-heap-memory]]The **Heap Memory Utilization** chart shows the memory usage
on the selected client with three different metrics
(maximum, used and total memory) represented by different colors. You can open this
chart as a separate window using the image:ROOT:MaximizeChart.png[maximize]
button placed at top right of it; this gives you a
clearer view of the chart.

[[general]]**General** is a dynamically updated window tab showing general
information about the client. Below are brief explanations
for each piece of information:

* **Name**: Name of the client instance.
* **Address**: Local IP address of the client that is used for
connecting to members.
* **Type**: Type of the client.
* **Enterprise**: Yes, if the client is an Hazelcast 
Enterprise client.
* **Member Connection**: Shows to which member a client is
currently connected to. Please note that *ALL* means a client
is configured so that it *might* connect to all members of
a cluster, i.e., it might not have a connection to all
members all the time.
* **Version**: Version of the client.
* **Last Connection to Cluster**: Time that the client connected
to the cluster. It is reset on each reconnection.
* **Last Statistics Collection**: Time when the latest update
for the statistics is collected from the client.
* **User Executor Queue Size**: Number of waiting tasks in the
client user executor.
* **Labels**: List of client labels (as defined by the client).

[[run-time]]Next to the **General** tab, the **Runtime** tab shows the
processor number, uptime, and maximum,
total and free memory sizes of the selected client. These
values are collected from the default MXBeans provided by the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs
and some explanations are below:

* **Number of Processors**: Number of processors available
to the client (JVM).
* **Up Time**: Uptime of the client (JVM).
* **Maximum Memory**: Maximum amount of memory that the
client (JVM) will attempt to use.
* **Total Memory**: Amount of total heap memory currently
available for current and future objects in the client (JVM).
* **Free Memory**: Amount of free heap memory in the client (JVM).
* **Used Memory**: Amount of used heap memory in the client (JVM).

[[os]]Next to the **Runtime** tab, the **OS** tab shows statistics
about the operating system of the client. These values are
collected from the default MXBeans provided by the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs and some
explanations are below:

* **Free Physical Memory**: Amount of free physical memory.
* **Committed Virtual Memory**:	Amount of virtual memory that
is guaranteed to be available to the running process.
* **Total Physical Memory**: Total amount of physical memory.
* **Free Swap Space**: Amount of free swap space. Swap space
is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full.
If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full,
inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.
* **Total Swap Space**:	Total amount of swap space.
* **Maximum File Descriptor Count**: Maximum number of file
descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that
uniquely represents an opened file in the operating system.
* **Open File Descriptor Count**: Number of open file descriptors.
* **Process CPU Time**:	CPU time used by the process on which
the member (JVM) is running.
* **System Load Average**: System load average for the last minute.
The system load average is the average over a period
of time of this sum: (the number of runnable entities queued to the
available processors) + (the number of runnable
entities running on the available processors). The way in which the
load average is calculated is operating system
specific but it is typically a damped time-dependent average.

NOTE: Some of the Runtime/OS statistics may not be available for
your client's
JVM implementation/operating system. **N/A** is shown for these
types of statistics. Please refer to your
JVM/operating system documentation for further details.

[[client-near-cache]]The **Client Near Cache Statistics** table shows statistics related
to the Near Cache of a client. There are two separate
tables; one for maps and one for caches.

* **Map/Cache Name**: Name of the map or cache.
* **Creation Time**: Creation time of this Near Cache on the client.
* **Evictions**: Number of evictions of Near Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Expirations**: Number of TTL and max-idle expirations of Near
Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Hits**: Number of hits (reads) of Near Cache entries owned by
the client.
* **Misses**: Number of misses of Near Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Owned Entry Count**: Number of Near Cache entries owned by the client.
* **Owned Entry Memory Cost**: Memory cost of Near Cache entries
owned by the client.
* **LP Duration**: Duration of the last Near Cache key persistence
(when the pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Key Count**: Number of Near Cache key persistences (when the
pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Time**: Time of the last Near Cache key persistence (when the
pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Written Bytes**: Written number of bytes of the last Near Cache
key persistence (when the pre-load feature is enabled).
* **LP Failure**: Failure reason of the last Near Cache persistence
(when the pre-load feature is enabled).

NOTE: Please note that you can configure the time interval for which
the client statistics are collected and sent to the cluster,
using the system property  `hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds`.
See the
xref:imdg:clients:java.adoc#client-system-properties[System Properties section]
in the Hazelcast documentation for more information.
