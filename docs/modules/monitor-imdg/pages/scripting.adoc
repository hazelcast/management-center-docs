[[scripting]]

You can use the scripting feature of the Management Center to execute scripts
on the cluster.

== Before you Begin

Scripting is disabled by default and you need to enable it
in your cluster's configuration. See the
xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:maintain-cluster:monitoring.adoc#management-center[Toggle Scripting Support] for details. The member list shows whether
scripting is enabled or disabled for each member.

NOTE: Scripting is currently unsupported for Java 15 and newer. These versions of Java do not come with a JavaScript engine, which is necessary for this feature to work.

== Scripting in JavaScript

To use this feature, click on the **Scripting** menu item
on the left panel.

In this window, the left panel is the actual script code editor.
The combo box located at the top part of the editor enables
you to select a scripting language: currently, JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy and Python
languages are supported. You can select the members on which the code will execute
from the **Members** list shown at the right side of the window.
After you write your script and press the **Execute** button, you can see
the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.

NOTE: To use the scripting languages other than JavaScript on a member,
the libraries for those languages should be placed in the classpath of that member.
See the <<scripting-languages, Enabling Additional Scripting Languages section>>
for more details.

There are **Save** and **Delete** buttons on the top right of the scripting editor.
To save your scripts, press the **Save** button after you type a name for your script
into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts**
part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. Click on a saved script from
this list to execute or edit it. If you want to remove a script that you wrote and saved
before, select it from this list and press the **Delete** button.

In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable
named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via
the `hazelcast` variable. You can see an example usage for JavaScript below:

```
var name = hazelcast.getName();
var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();
var employees = hazelcast.getMap("employees");
employees.put("1","John Doe");
employees.get("1"); // will return "John Doe"
```

== Enabling Additional Scripting Languages

Hazelcast members use the `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` API for the execution of the script.
Only the JavaScript engine is available in most JVMs by default.
To use a scripting language other than JavaScript on a member, you need to add the
corresponding scripting engine to the classpath of that member. Here is an example of
Maven configuration for several scripting engines:

```xml
