= Cluster Administration
[[administering-management-center]]

Using the "Administration" menu item, you can change the
state of your cluster, shut down it, update your Management Center
license and perform Rolling Upgrade or Hot Restart
on your cluster.

When you click on the "Administration" menu item, the following
page shows up:

image:ROOT:Administration.png[Administration Menu]

NOTE: This menu item is available only to admin users.

You can perform the aforementioned administrative tasks using
the tabs on this page. Below sections explain each tab.

[[cluster-state]]
== Cluster State

The admin user can see and change the cluster state and shut
down the cluster using the buttons listed in this page as shown below.

image:ROOT:ClusterState.png[Cluster State Operations]

**Cluster States:**

* **Active**: The cluster continues to operate without any
restriction. All operations are allowed. This is the default
state of a cluster.
* **No Migration**: Migrations (partition rebalancing) and backup
replications are not allowed. The cluster continues to operate without
any restriction. All other operations are allowed.
* **Frozen**: New members are not allowed to join, except the members
left in **this** or the **Passive** state. All other operations except
migrations are allowed and the cluster operates without any restriction.
* **Passive**: New members are not allowed to join, except the members
left in **this** or the **Frozen** state. All operations, except the
ones marked with `AllowedDuringPassiveState`, are rejected immediately.
* **In Transition**: Shows that the cluster state is in transition. This
is a temporary and intermediate state. It is not allowed to set it explicitly.

**Changing the Cluster State**

image:ROOT:ChangeClusterState.png[Changing Cluster state]

* Click the dropdown menu and choose the state to which you want your cluster
to change. A pop-up appears and stays on the screen until the state is successfully changed.

image:ROOT:ChangeClusterState-wait.png[Waiting the State Change]

**Shutting Down the Cluster**

* Click the **Shutdown** button. A pop-up appears and stays on the screen
until the cluster is successfully shutdown.

image:ROOT:ShutdownCluster.png[Shutdown Cluster]

If an exception occurs during the state change or shutdown operation on the
cluster, this exception message is shown on the screen as a notification.

[[rolling-upgrade]]
== Rolling Upgrade

The admin user can upgrade the cluster version once all members of
the cluster have been upgraded to the intended
codebase version as described in the Rolling Upgrade Procedure section
of the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#rolling-upgrade-procedure[Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual].

Open the **Rolling Upgrade** tab to perform a Rolling Upgrade
and change the cluster's version.

image:ROOT:RollingUpgrade.png[RollingUpgradeMenu]

Enter the password of the cluster if security is enabled on the cluster
(leave it empty if not), and click on the **Change Version** button.

Once the operation succeeds, you will see the following notification:

image:ROOT:UpgradeClusterVersionSuccess.png[UpgradeClusterVersionSuccess]

[[hot-restart]]
== Hot Restart

Using the Hot Restart tab, you can perform force and partial start of
the cluster and see the Hot Restart status of the cluster members. You
can also take snapshots of the Hot Restart Store (Hot Backup). When you
click on this tab, the following page is shown:

image:ROOT:HotRestartTab.png[Hot Restart Tab]

Below sections explain each operation.

=== Force Start

Restart process cannot be completed if a member crashes permanently and
cannot recover from the failure since it cannot start or it fails to load
its own data. In that case, you can force the cluster to clean its persisted
data and make a fresh start. This process is called **force start**.

NOTE: See the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#force-start[Force Start section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual for more information on this operation.

To perform a force start on the cluster, click on the **Force Start** button.
A confirmation dialog appears as shown below.

image:ROOT:ForceStartConfirmation.png[Force Start Confirmation]

Once you click on the **Force Start** button on this dialog, the cluster
starts the force start process and the following progress dialog shows
up while doing so.

image:ROOT:ForceStart.png[Force Starting]

This dialog stays on the screen until the operation is triggered. Once
it is done, the success of force start operation is shown as a notice
dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:ForceStartSuccessful.png[Force Start Success]

If an exception occurs, this exception message is shown on the
screen as a notification.

=== Partial Start

When one or more members fail to start or have incorrect Hot Restart
data (stale or corrupted data) or fail to load their Hot Restart data,
the cluster becomes incomplete and the restart mechanism cannot proceed.
One solution is to use Force Start and make a fresh start with the existing
members, as explained above. Another solution is to do a partial start.

Partial start means that the cluster will start with an incomplete set of
members. Data belonging to the missing members is assumed lost and
the Management Center tries to recover the missing data using the restored
backups. For example, if you have minimum two backups configured for all
the maps and caches, then a partial start up to two missing members is
safe against data loss. If there are more than two missing members or there
are maps/caches with less than two backups, then data loss is expected.

NOTE: See the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/#partial-start[Partial Start section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual for more information on this
operation and how to enable it.

To perform a partial start on the cluster, click on the **Partial Start**
button. A notice dialog appears as shown below.

image:ROOT:PartialStartTriggered.png[Partial Start Triggered]

You can also see two fields related to Partial Start operation:
"Remaining Data Load Time" and "Remaining Validation Time", as shown
in the above screenshot.

* **Remaining Validation Time**: When partial start is enabled, Hazelcast
can perform a partial start automatically or manually, in case of some members
are unable to restart successfully. Partial start proceeds automatically when
some members fail to start and join to the cluster in `validation-timeout-seconds`,
which you can configure. After this duration is passed, Hot Restart chooses to perform
a partial start with the members present in the cluster. This field, i.e.,
"Remaining Validation Time" shows how much time is left to the automatic partial
start, in seconds. You can always request a manual partial start, by clicking on
the **Partial Start** button, before this duration passes.
* **Remaining Data Load Time**: The other situation to decide to perform a partial
start is the failures during the data loading phase. When Hazelcast learns the data loading
result of all members which have passed the validation step, it automatically performs
a partial start with the ones which have successfully restored their Hot Restart data.
Note that partial start does not expect every member to succeed in the data
loading step. It completes the process when it learns the data loading result for every
member and there is at least one member which has successfully restored its Hot
Restart data. Relatedly, if it cannot learn the data loading result of all members
before `data-load-timeout-seconds` duration, it proceeds with the ones which have
already completed the data loading process. This field, i.e., "Remaining Data Load Time"
shows how much time (in seconds) is left for Hazelcast to know at least one member
has successfully restored its Hot Restart data and perform an automatic partial start.

NOTE: See the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual for more information on the configuration elements `validation-timeout-seconds`
and `data-load-timeout-seconds` mentioned above and how to configure them.

NOTE: Force and partial start operations can also be performed using the REST
API and the script `cluster.sh`. See the
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#using-rest-api-for-cluster-management[Using REST API for Cluster Management section]
and http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#using-the-script-clustersh[Using the Script cluster.sh section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

=== Hot Backup

During Hot Restart operations, you can take a snapshot of the Hot
Restart data at a certain point in time. This is useful when you
wish to bring up a new cluster with the same data or parts of the data.
The new cluster can then be used to share load with the original cluster,
to perform testing, quality assurance or reproduce an issue on the production data.

Note that you must first configure the Hot Backup directory programmatically
(using the method `setBackupDir()`) or declaratively (using the element `backup-dir`)
to be able to take a backup of the Hot Restart data. See the
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/#configuring-hot-backup[Configuring Hot Backup section]
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

If the backup directory is configured, you can start to perform the backup by
clicking on the **Hot Backup** button. The Management Center first asks
the cluster password as shown in the following dialog.

image:ROOT:HotBackupAskPassword.png[Hot Backup Ask Cluster Password]

Once you entered the password correctly and click on the "Start" button on
this dialog, you will see a notification dialog stating that the backup process
starts. You can see the progress of the backup operation under the "Last Hot
Backup Task Status" part of the page, as shown below.

image:ROOT:HotBackupProgress.png[Hot Backup Progress]

=== Status Information

At the bottom of "Hot Restart" tab, you can see the Hot Restart and
Hot Backup statuses of cluster members, as shown below.

image:ROOT:StatusInformation.png[Status]

You can see the status and progress of your Hot Backup operation under
"Last Hot Backup Task Status". It can be IN_PROGRESS and SUCCESS/FAILURE
according to the result of the operation.

You can also see the status of Hot Restart operation of your cluster members,
under "Hot Restart Status". It can be PENDING and SUCCESSFUL/FAILED according
to the result of Hot Restart operation.

[[cp-subsystem]]
== CP Subsystem

NOTE: CP subsystem management operations require enabled REST API in the IMDG cluster. See the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#rest-client[IMDG documentation]
for more information.

The **CP Subsystem** tab can be used to monitor overall status of the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem[CP subsystem]
in the current cluster and perform certain management operations.

image:ROOT:CPSubsystemTab.png[Status]

=== Monitoring CP Subsystem

The **Status** field shows a summary of the current CP subsystem status. It may have one of
the following values:

* **CP Subsystem is not supported by this cluster:** Shown for IMDG clusters with version prior to 3.12.
* **CP Subsystem is not enabled:** Shown if CP subsystem is not enabled for the current cluster.
* **All CP members are accessible:** Shown if there are at least the same amount of accessible CP members
as the configured CP member count.
* **CP Subsystem warning: one CP member is not accessible:** Shown if there is one missing
CP member and the minority count in the CP subsystem is greater than 1. For example, this value is shown
when there are 6 accessible CP members and the configured count is 7. In this example, the minority
count is 3 members and the majority count is 4 members.
* **CP Subsystem alert:  multiple CP members are not accessible:** Shown if there are multiple missing
CP members, but their count is less than the minority.
* **CP Subsystem error: minority of the CP members are not accessible:** Shown if the minority of CP
members are missing.
* **CP Subsystem error: majority of the CP members are not accessible:** Shown if the majority of CP
members are missing.

The **CP Members (Accessible/Configured)** field shows the current count of accessible CP members and the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem-configuration[configured CP members count].

NOTE: You may promote additional members or remove inaccessible CP members,
so the total count of members that participate in the CP subsystem may be greater or less than the
configured CP member count. As the Status field considers the configured CP member count as the total
CP member count, it should be treated only as a basic health indicator for the CP subsystem.

=== Managing CP Subsystem

You can also use the CP Subsystem tab to start the following management operations.

**Promote Member to CP Subsystem**

To promote one of the AP members to become a CP member, click on the **Promote** button. A confirmation
dialog appears as shown below.

image:ROOT:CPPromoteDialog.png[Promote Member to CP Confirmation]

It asks you to choose one of AP members, i.e., one of the members that do not participate in the CP subsystem.
Note that lite members are not shown in the dropdown list as lite members do not store data.
Once you press the **Promote** button, the CP subsystem starts the promote operation for the given member.

**Remove CP Member**

To remove one of the inaccessible CP members from the CP subsystem, click on the **Remove** button. A confirmation
dialog appears as shown below.

image:ROOT:CPRemoveDialog.png[Remove CP Member Confirmation]

It asks you to choose one of the members that is not connected to the Management Center, but is known by
the cluster's CP subsystem. Once you press the **Remove** button, the CP subsystem starts the remote
operation for the given member.

**Restart CP Subsystem**

To wipe and restart the whole CP subsystem of the cluster, click on the **Restart** button. A confirmation
dialog appears as shown below.

image:ROOT:CPRestartDialog.png[Restart CP Subsystem Confirmation]

Once you press the **Restart** button, CP subsystem proceeds with the restart operation.

WARNING: The CP subsystem restart operation is **NOT** idempotent and multiple invocations can break the
whole system! After using this dialog, you must observe the system to see if the restart process is
successfully completed or failed before starting this operation again.
