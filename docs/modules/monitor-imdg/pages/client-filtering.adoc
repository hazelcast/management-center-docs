= Changing Cluster Client Filtering
[[changing-cluster-client-filtering]]

NOTE: The Filter tab is only available with Hazelcast license
that includes the Cluster Client Filtering feature.

The **Filter** tab includes **Cluster Client Filtering** status,
**Cluster Client Filter Settings** and **Client Filtering
Lists** sections, as shown below.

The **Cluster Client Filtering** status section describes if there
is a deployed client filtering list available to all cluster
members (**Enabled** status), or if the feature is disabled for the
cluster and the members allow any clients (**Disabled** status).

The **Cluster Client Filter Settings** section allows to specify the
status of the feature and the filtering type and to deploy
any modifications made in client filtering lists to the deployed list
available to all cluster members. On the deploy action
the following happens:

* If the status to be deployed is **Disabled**, the deployed client
filtering list available to all cluster members is cleaned up
and the members start allowing any client to connect.
* If the status to be deployed is **Enabled**, all entries of the
matching lists from the Client Filtering Lists section are
copied into the deployed client filtering list and applied to
all cluster members. Matching lists are selected by
their status (**List Status** must be **Active**) and type (**List
Type** must match the value of the **Client Filter Type**
selection).

Once a cluster member receives the deployed client filtering list
from the Management Center, it immediately applies the list to
all currently connected clients and then uses it for newly connecting
clients. Deny-listed clients may connect to another cluster
if they are configured to support blue-green deployment. If they are not,
they shut down when denied access to the cluster. Please see the
https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/clients/java.html#blue-green-deployment-and-disaster-recovery[Blue-Green Deployment and Disaster Recovery section]
in the Hazelcast documentation for more information.

NOTE: If some of the cluster members are not reachable from
the Management Center, those members keep using the last client
list applied to them.

The deploy action in the Cluster Client Filter Settings section is
available by clicking on the **Deploy Changes** button. 
The button is disabled if there are no changes in client
filtering lists that would lead to changes in the deployed
client filtering list as the result of the deploy.

There is also the **Summary** button. By clicking on the button a modal appears.
It shows a summary of what the effect of the deployed config will be.

The **Client Filter Lists** section allows creation, editing and
deletion of the client filtering lists. To create a new client
filtering list, you need to click the **Add New List** button, which
will open the Create List form, as shown below. Once you
enter all fields and entries for the new list, click the **Save**
button to save your modifications.

The following formats of list entry values are supported:

* For the IP Address entry type you can specify IP address (IPv4 or
IPv6) with optional range characters (`\*` and `-`) instead of any
byte group. For instance, `10.3.10.*` refers to IPs between `10.3.10.0`
and `10.3.10.255`. The `10.3.10.4-18` refers to IPs between `10.3.10.4`
and `10.3.10.18` (4 and 18 included).
* For the Label entry type you can specify any string with optional
wildcard characters (`\*`). For instance, `green*` refers to any label
values that start with the `green` string.
* For the Instance Name entry type you can specify any string with
optional wildcard characters (`\*`). For instance, `*-client` refers
to any label values that end with the `-client` string.

To modify an existing client filtering list, you need to click the
**Edit** button, which will open the Edit List form,
as shown below.

To delete an existing client filtering list, you need to click the
**Delete** button and confirm your action in the opened dialog.

NOTE: Any modifications made in the Client Filtering Lists section
will become available to members only after the deploy action.

NOTE: Deploying an empty allow list disconnects all clients.

== Example Client Filtering

In this section we show how you can deploy your filtering list for better understanding.
In the beginning, the client filtering feature is disabled and there are no filter lists.

Let's create a new filter list:

* We click the **New List** button and a screen with two forms appears.
* We fill the first form as follows:
** Filter Name: 'Example_allow_list'
** Filter Status: 'Active'
** Filter Type: 'Allow-list'
* Next we want to add two IP addresses to our soon-to-be allow-list.
To achieve this we need to fill the second form twice:
** First entry:
*** Type: 'IP Address'
*** Value: '1.2.3.4'
* We hit the **Add Entry** button.
** Second entry:
*** Type: 'IP Address'
***Value: '5.6.7.8'
* Again, we hit the **Add Entry** button.

To save our brand new allow-list we hit the **Save** button. The allow-list is saved and we are redirected 
to client filtering overview as shown on the image bellow.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep3.png[Example Step 3]

In the **Client Filter Lists** we can see that our list has
a grey background, meaning it is not in use right now.
When we change **Filter Status** value to 'Enabled' and select **Filter Type**
as 'Allow-list', we are able to deploy our new allow-list; the **Deploy Changes** and **Summary** buttons
are enabled and our allow-list has a little cross 
in the **Deploy** column.

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep4.png[Example Step 4]

Before deploying our allow-list, let's check what will be deployed
by clicking on the **Summary** button.
After the click, a modal opens; we can see that it contains our changes (two IP addresses, **1.2.3.4** and **5.6.7.8**).

image:ROOT:ClientFilteringExampleStep5.png[Example Step 5]

Finally, let's deploy our changes by clicking the **Deploy Changes** button. 
After a brief moment, we have our allow-list deployed.
The **Deploy Changes** and **Summary** buttons become disabled again and our
list has no cross in the **Deploy** column
as there are no changes to be deployed.
