= Monitoring Data Structures
[[monitoring-data-structures]]

This chapter provides information on how
you can monitor the Hazelcast data structures
in your cluster.

[[managing-maps]]
== Maps

You can see a list of all the maps in your cluster
by clicking on the **Maps** menu item on the left panel. A new
page is opened on the right, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapGridView.png[Map Grid View]

You can filter the maps shown and you can also sort
the table by clicking on the column headers. Clicking
on a map name opens a new page for monitoring that map
instance on the right, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MonitoringMaps.png[Monitoring Maps]

The below subsections explain the portions of this window.

[[map-browser]]
=== Map Browser

Use the Map Browser tool to retrieve properties of the
entries stored in the selected map. To open the Map Browser
tool, click on the **Map Browser** button, located at the
top right of the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a
dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapBrowser.png[Map Browser]

Once the key and the key's type are specified and the **Browse**
button is clicked, the key's properties along with its value are
listed.

.Fields Description
* **Value**: Value that is associated with the key in the map.
* **Class**: Key's Java class.
* **Memory Cost**: Space, in bytes, the key and value cost to be hold in memory.
* **Creation Time**: First time the key was put.
* **Expiration Time**: Time the key was expired and deleted from the map (depends on expiration policy configuration).
* **Hits**: Count of reads by the clients for the key's value in a map.
* **Last Access Time**: Last time the clients read the key's value.
* **Last Stored Time**: Last time the key was stored into the storage.
* **Version**: Count of times where the key's value has been overwritten.
* **Time to Live**: Last set time to live (in milliseconds).
* **Max Idle**: Last set max idle time (in milliseconds).

If you are using a serialization mechanism other than standard Java
serialization for storing values in your map, you need to
configure the client that Management Center uses for connecting to the
cluster (as described xref:imdg:serialization:serialization.adoc[here]). Note that if you
have any custom classes, you need to add the JAR containing them
to Management Center's classpath before starting it as described in
the xref:ROOT:configuring.adoc#starting-with-an-extra-classpath[Providing an Extra Classpath section]. In case the value stored in the map is not a `String`
or of another Java primitive type, it is rendered as a JSON value as shown below:

image:ROOT:MapBrowserWithCustomTypedValue.png[Map Browser with Custom Typed Value]

[[map-config]]
=== Map Config

Use the Map Config tool to set the selected map's attributes, such
as the max size, TTL, and eviction policy. To open the Map Config
tool, click on the **Map Config** button, located at the top right of
the window. Once opened, the tool appears as a dialog, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapConfig.png[Map Config Tool]

You can change any attribute and click the **Update** button to save
your changes.

[[map-monitoring]]
=== Map Monitoring

Besides the Map Browser and Map Config tools, the map monitoring
page shows two widgets that show various metrics of the map.
See the xref:widget.adoc[Widget section] for more information.

Under these charts are **Map Statistics**, **Map Throughput**,
 **Member Near Cache**, and **Client Near Cache** data tables.

[[map-statistics]]**Map Statistic Table** provides statistics distributed
over the members, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MapStatisticDataTable.png[Map Statistic Data Table]

From left to right, this table lists the following:

* **Members**: IP address and port of the member.
* **Entries**: Number of entries owned by the member.
* **Gets**: Number of get operations received by the member.

* **Entry Memory**: Memory cost of owned entries in the member.
* **Backups**: Number of backup entries held by the member.
* **Backup Memory**: Memory cost of backup entries held by the member.
* **Events**: Number of events received by the member.
* **Hits**: Number of hits (reads) of the entries that are owned by
the member, including those which are no longer in the map (for
example, may have been evicted). The number of hits may be inaccurate
after a partition is migrated to a new owner member.
* **Locks**: Number of currently locked entries owned by the member.
* **Dirty Entries**: Number of entries that the member owns and are
dirty (updated but not persisted yet). In the cases where *MapStore*
is enabled, these are the entries that are put to/removed from the
map but not written to/removed from a database yet.

[[monitoring-locks]]
== Locks

You can use the scripting feature of the Management Center to
monitor the locks in your cluster. See the xref:scripting.adoc[Scripting section]
to learn how to use this feature.

You can use the below scripts to retrieve various information
about the locks in your cluster.

To find the number of active locks in your cluster, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var findLocks = function() {
    var lockstr = '';
    var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();

    var locks = hazelcast.node.nodeEngine.getService('hz:impl:lockService').getAllLocks();
    return "Active Lock Count : " + locks.size();

}

findLocks();
----

To print the locks in your cluster, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var findLocks = function() {
        var lockStr = '';
        var distributedObjects = hazelcast.getDistributedObjects();
        for each(distributedObject in distributedObjects) {
            if(distributedObject.getServiceName().equals("hz:impl:lockService")){
                lockStr += distributedObject.getName() + '\n';
            }

        }
        return lockStr;
}

findLocks();
----

To force unlock a lock in your cluster, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var forceUnlock = function(lockName) {

    hazelcast.getLock(lockName).forceUnlock();
    return 'OK';

}

forceUnlock('your_Lock_Name');
----

To check if a lock is being hold by a member, use the following script:

[source,plain]
----
var isLocked = function(lockName) {

    var locked = hazelcast.getLock(lockName).isLocked();
    return lockName + ' -> ' + locked;

}

isLocked('your_Lock_Name');
----

[[monitoring-pn-counters]]

was incremented per second during the last timeslice.
* **Decrement Operations/s**: Average number of times the counter
was decremented per second during the last timeslice.
* **Number of Replicas**: Number of member instances that
have a state for the counter.

coming from all the members to a generator, i.e., total batch
requests from all members to a generator divided by the member
count for that generator.
* **Avg. Batch Size:** Average size of the ID batches created
by a generator, i.e., total number of IDs generated (the sum
of IDs for all batches) for all members divided by the total
count of batch requests coming from all members.

[[id-generator-details]]Clicking on a generator name opens a new page for
monitoring that specific generator instance, as shown below.

image:ROOT:MonitoringFlakeIdGens.png[Monitoring Flake ID Generators]

The table can likewise be sorted by clicking the column
headers.
It shows IP and port of the members that have a state for
the specific generator named in the page's title.
The monitoring data available are:

* **Batch Requests:** Total count of batch requests to a
generator by this member.
* **Avg. Batch Size:** Average size of the ID batches
created for this member, i.e., total number of IDs generated
(the sum of IDs for all batches) for this member divided by
the total count of batch requests coming from this member.

NOTE: The operations per second is not the number of new IDs
generated or used but the number of ID batches.
The batch size is configurable, usually it contains hundreds
or thousands of IDs.
A client uses all IDs from a batch before a new batch is requested.
