= Executing Console Commands
[[console]]

**Disclaimer: It is not recommended for production use.**

The Management Center has a console feature that enables you to
execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform
``put``s and ``get``s on a map, after you set the namespace with
the command `ns <name of your map>`. The same is valid for queues,
topics and other data structures that can be monitored on the Management
Center. To execute your command, type it into the field below the console
and press **Enter**. Type `help` to see all the commands that you can use.

Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located on
the left panel or the one located at the top menu. You can also open it
by using `ALT + T` keyboard shortcut on Windows/Linux and `Option + T` on
macOS. Below is a sample view with the `help` command executed.

NOTE: The Management Center Console does not support data structures with spaces or special characters in their names.
